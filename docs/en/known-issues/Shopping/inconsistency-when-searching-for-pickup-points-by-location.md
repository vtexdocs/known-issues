## Summary

There is inconsistent behavior when searching for pickup points by browser location, even with location enabled and authorized. This sometimes causes the search not to return nearby pickup point options and not to update the map with the user's location.

## Simulation

1. In your store, add items to the cart and proceed to checkout;
2. Choose the pickup option;
3. Allow the browser to use your location;
4. Notice that a message is displayed indicating that there are no nearby pickup points;
5. Enter the address manually;
6. Notice that the platform now displays the pickup point options.


## Workaround

Currently, there is no workaround for this scenario.
