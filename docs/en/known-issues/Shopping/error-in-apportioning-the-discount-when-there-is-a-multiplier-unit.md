## Summary

In cases of orders with discount that have non-integer multiplier items, rounding is performed per item, not after the sum of all items.

This can result in the loss of a few cents.

## Simulation

- Create percentage promotion.
- Receive an order with items that use non-integer multiplier.
- Analyze the apportionment of the discount.

## Workaround

At the moment, we do not have a workaround for this scenario.
