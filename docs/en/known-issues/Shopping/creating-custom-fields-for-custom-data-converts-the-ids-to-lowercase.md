## Summary

By creating "custom fields" in the "custom data" section through the checkout API, the IDs of the reported apps are converted to lowercase letters.

## Simulation

1. Use the [POST Update Custom Fields](https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/18468/vtex-checkout-api/6Z2QYJM#dc90afae-a4e5-59c5-1854-fc0fa81c99ee) API;
2. Send an "app" that has an "ID" with an uppercase letter (for example, "customFieldTest");
3. Note in the response of the request that the "ID" was converted to lowercase letters (in the example above, it would be "customfieldtest").

## Workaround

Currently this is an API restriction. It's not possible to get around this scenario. Custom Data Custom Fields must be used with lowercase letters.
