## Summary

When a discount is applied, there is a divergence between the total value of a kit and the sum of its components values.

### Example 1:

One kit is priced at $ 7.72. This kit receives a discount of $ 1.16. When the price of the kit is distributed among its components, the sum of the components price is $ 7.70.

### Example 2:

One kit is priced at $ 7.72. This kit receives a discount of $ 1.16. When the apportionment of the discount is made among its components, the sum of the components discount is $ 1.40.

This error occurs because of the rounding performed in the divisions of the values.

With this difference of values, tenants can not enter the Invoice in their systems.

## Simulation

1. In **Catalog** module, register a kit with 4 components;
2. In the **Pricing** module, create a promotion for this kit;
3. Close an order with this kit with the promotion applied;
4. The order's JSON or XML will display the divergence between the total value and the sum value of the parts.

## Workaround

This is an intermittent scenario. The momentary solution is to manually enter the values so that the ERP can generate the invoice with the correct value.
