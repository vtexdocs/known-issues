## Summary

When a cart has more than 20 items, its display is partially obstructed, instead displaying a "show more items button".

In such cases, the shipping calculator displays an inconsistent behavior, showing two selectors and divergent values between them.

This only occurs when using Checkout v5.

## Simulation

- use a store with checkout v5
- have a cart with more than 20 items
- calculate shipping for that cart in order to observe its behavior

## Workaround

This scenario does not occur anymore within the 6th version of Checkout, which uses the "Shipping Preview" component to calculate cart shipping.
