## Summary

At present, the possibility to display the "Receive | Pick up" options is subject to a CEP (ZIP code) search in any of the tabs. This means that, if for example you would search for a ZIP code that doesn't offer the pick-up point option in the "Receive" tab, the "Pick-up" tab would not be displayed.

## Simulation

1. When finalizing a purchase, go to the "Delivery" step;
2. In the "Receive" tab, search for a ZIP code that isn't catered to by any pick-up point;
3. You'll notice that the "Receive" tab doesn't appear.

## Workaround

The solution comes to light through the customization of CSS, forcing it to display the class, as shown below:

  .shipping-method-wrapper{display:block}
