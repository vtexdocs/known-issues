## Summary

Credit card information cannot be removed from an [`orderForm`](https://developers.vtex.com/vtex-rest-api/reference/checkout-api-overview) via route `/api/checkout/pub/orderForm/{orderFormId}/paymentAccount/{accountId}/remove` when using `appKey`/`appToken` as credentials.

When an `appKey` with the appropriate [permissions](https://help.vtex.com/pt/tutorial/roles--7HKK5Uau2H6wxE1rH5oRbc#) submits a request to this route, the API returns an error with `status 500`:
"Attempted to perform an unauthorized operation."

Note that it is not an error with `status 403`, as is usual for authorization failures.

## Simulation



## Workaround

Currently, there is no workaround.
