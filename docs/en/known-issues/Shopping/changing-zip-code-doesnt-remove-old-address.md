## Summary

When you change the zip code, the previously filled address is not removed from the form.

This scenario only happens in version 6 of SmartCheckout and is limited to the user experience, with no major flaws related to it.

## Simulation

1. In any cart, enter the zip code, number and complement;
2. Change the zip code;
3. Note that the number and complement fields hold the data from the first step. The expected behavior was to clear them and ask for new data.

## Workaround

There is no known workaround for this scenario.
