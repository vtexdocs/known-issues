## Summary

Google Shopping makes sent products expire automatically after 30 days if they are not upgraded. This includes any changes to the product, be it price, inventory, or specification. For products that have not been updated in any way, you would need to reindex them to notify the integration.

However, notifications only happen if there is a change in price/inventory/product. Thus, only reindexing the database will not influence the delivery of products to the integration. In this way, expired products on Google Shopping need to be updated so that the integration is notified.

## Simulation

1. Choose an expired product on Google Shopping.
2. Reindex this product on VTEX.
3. The integration will not be notified and the product will not be active on Google Shopping.

## Workaround

Make a price or inventory change to the desired products and they will be resent to Google Shopping.
