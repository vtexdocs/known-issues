## Summary

The Excel export spreadsheet of VTEX Integrations orders cannot be filtered by error type. The excel only shows that there is an error, but not which.

The Operations team does not have visibility of the error type that each order, product, price and inventory has, which can therefore not be prioritized, managed and resold en masse.

## Simulation

1. Access the Integrations module;
2. Click on the Orders / Product / Price / Inventory tab;
3. Export the excel;
4. Analyze the column "status", where you can see that only "Error" is shown.

## Workaround

The operations team must analyze each Order / Product / Price / Inventory to then take a course of action.
