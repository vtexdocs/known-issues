## Summary

Bridge does not allow filtering orders, products, prices, inventory by Period in the admin list, neither in the excel spreadsheet, to work with segmented information.

## Simulation

1. Access the Bridge menu;
2. Click on the Orders / Product / Price / Inventory tab;
3. Click on the filter icon or Export to excel;
4. Both the list and the spreadsheet inform that there is no way to filter by Period.

## Workaround

The operations team must export the information through the available filters and analyze the items manually in order to get a result.
