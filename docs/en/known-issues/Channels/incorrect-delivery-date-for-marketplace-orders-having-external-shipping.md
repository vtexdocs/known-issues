## Summary

The delivery date for marketplace orders using external shipping (FOB type, such as Mercado Envios and B2W Entrega) is displayed in the order management system (OMS) according to the logistics of the seller, which may be different than the date calculated on the marketplace.

## Simulation

N/A

## Workaround

At present, VTEX orders service cannot include a custom date based on external information. This improvement is in our backlog.

There is no workaround available, you'll need to check the date in the marketplace environment directly.
