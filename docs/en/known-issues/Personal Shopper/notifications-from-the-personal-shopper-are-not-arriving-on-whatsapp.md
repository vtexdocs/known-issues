## Summary


In the Personal Shopper app, when a video call is initiated by a user on the store's front end, the attendant does not receive notifications on WhatsApp.


#### Simulation


To simulate this, you will need a demo account and register an attendant as your WhatsApp. On the front end, access the Personal Shopper widget and start a call. You will see that the notification does not arrive on WhatsApp, only in your email.


#### Workaround


N/A
