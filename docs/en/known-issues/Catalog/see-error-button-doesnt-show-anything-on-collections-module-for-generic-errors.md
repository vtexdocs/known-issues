## Summary


When using the collections module, if a generic error is found (an error that has no specific reasont, for instance a timeout), and the user attempts to use the "see error" function, nothing is shown.


#### Simulation


This issue is unlikely to be consistently simulated, sometimes, when checking the "see error" button, for a few actions, nothing is shown, due to the systems incomplete coverage of error causes.


#### Workaround
