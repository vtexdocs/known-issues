## Summary


Trying to update the "UrlLogo" field in the /api/catalog_system/pvt/seller route isn't reflecting any changes.

Also, the value in the API is always returned as null regardless of the value set in the interface field.



## Simulation



- Send a request with a valid value on the UrlLogo field using this API: https://developers.vtex.com/vtex-rest-api/reference/catalog-api-seller#catalog-api-post-seller
- Wait for cache (something like 5 to 10 minutes) and check that this field UrlLogo will return as empty: https://developers.vtex.com/vtex-rest-api/reference/catalog-api-seller#catalog-api-get-seller

Notice that the URL logo field is not updating, it always returns a "null" value. (Even after 1h+, not cache at all)



## Workaround
