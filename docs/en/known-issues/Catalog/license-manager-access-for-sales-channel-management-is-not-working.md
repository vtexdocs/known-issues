## Summary


At the License Manager configuration, we can select which resource the user can access. The Sales Channels management is not giving access to the Sales Channel configuration page: `account.myvtex.com/admin/Site/Store.aspx`



## Simulation


- Change a user role to access only the Sales Channels Management:

 ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vtexdocs/help-center-content/refs/heads/main/docs/en/known-issues/Catalog/license-manager-access-for-sales-channel-management-is-not-working_1.png)

- Try to access this page: `account.myvtex.com/admin/Site/Store.aspx`

The page will not be available on the menu:

## Workaround


Use a role that gives access to all the catalog.
