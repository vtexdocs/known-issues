## Summary


At the seller management UI, remove or add a new trade policy to a seller.

This process is saved successfully, however the information is not automatically updated at the indexer of products related to that specific seller.

As a consequence, the seller's offer at these products will be outdated as:
- still available at the trade policy (if the action was to remove it);
- not available at the trade policy (if the action was to add it).



##

## Simulation



- Check a product that has an offer by a seller at a specific trade policy;
- Remove the trade policy from this seller using the Seller Management UI;
- Check that the action did not reflected at the product.


##

## Workaround


Index the product manually.
