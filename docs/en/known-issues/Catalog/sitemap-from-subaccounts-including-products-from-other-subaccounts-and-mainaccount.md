## Summary


The sitemap generated is showing all the products from subaccounts and accounts, not taking into consideration the sales channel of the products and if the subaccount has a website of its own.



## Simulation



1. Enter a account or subaccount and generate the sitemap by going to the link http://{accountName}.myvtex.com/sitemap/product-1.xml
2. Verify that the list of products also contain products from subaccounts that have different sales channels.



## Workaround


No workaround.
