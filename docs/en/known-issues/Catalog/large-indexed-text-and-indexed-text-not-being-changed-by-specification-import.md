## Summary





Currently, for every product specification import type, the "`Large Indexed Text`" and "`Indexed Text`" are not recognizing changes in specification values via the Product Specification Sheet import.




## Simulation


1) Create a  "`Large Indexed Text`" or "`Indexed Text`" type product specification.

2) Export a Product Specification sheet of a category in which this specification was created: at ProdutoExportacaoImportacaoEspecificacaoV2.aspx and try to change a specification value.

3) Check your product in which you've requested for changes, none were made.





## Workaround


Using other text types, such as "`Large Text`" or "`Text`"
