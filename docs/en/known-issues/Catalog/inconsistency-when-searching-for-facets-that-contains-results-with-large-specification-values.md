## Summary


The facets API has a specificationFilters field and this field can break the API return when the values registered in any specification of that category are too large


##

## Simulation



- In a category, create a Large Text field
- Add in the product a large value
- Save the product and wait for it to be indexed
- Call the Facets API and see that it returns no results


##

## Workaround


Adjust the size of the values
