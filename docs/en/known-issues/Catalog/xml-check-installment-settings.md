## Summary


Currently, the XML file generation is not working for specific types of currencies, such as AOA and ETB.

An error message is shown in the XML file:

"error to generate the sku, please check installment settings"


#### Simulation


Simply by configuring a XML configuration with these currencies, the error message is shown.


#### Workaround


Use other currencies instead.
