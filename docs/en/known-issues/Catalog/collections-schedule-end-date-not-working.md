## Summary


Currently, when a scheduled collection's end date is reached, the reindexing process for products contained within it is not triggered, consequently making the end date scheduling not functional as a whole.



## Simulation





1) Create a new collection either via the new collections admin module or the legacy CMS collections.

2) Set an end date for this specific collection to expire a few minutes ahead of the current date:

3) Insert 1+ products into this collection and save it.

4) The inserted product should now be reindexed

5) Wait for the scheduled end date

6) The product will not be reindexed and consequently not be removed from the given collection.



## Workaround


Manually reindex the products
