When indexing a product with translated information the app messages is requested. These requests are supposed to be under 3s and when they take more than that the indexation fails and generates an invalide translation document.



##

## Simulation


There is no easy way to reproduce this scenario, but accounts with a lot of languages or a lot of fields to translate are more susceptible to this scenario.


##

## Workaround


N/A
