## Summary


Currently, the "custom elements" tab of the legacy CMS configurations is not working properly.

Setting up a custom element of this type will not yield effects in most cases and directly setting it up in the layout's HTML is recommended.

This only happens for legacy template stores.


##

## Simulation


1 - go to the legacy CMS and select the custom elements tab
2 - upload a custom element of the "banner" type
3 - reference this banner in your html
4 - the configured banner will not render properly


##

## Workaround


set up the banners by using the type HTML layout and/or subtemplates associated to it.

OR

migrate to the VTEX store framework
