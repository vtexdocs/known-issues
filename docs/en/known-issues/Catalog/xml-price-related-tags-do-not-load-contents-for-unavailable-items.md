## Summary


The XML integration loads any tag related to price, such as minPrice, maxPrice, currentPrice, are loaded as a null value tag (<![CDATA[]]>) when the item is not available and also set to show if unavailable.


##

## Simulation


1 - Configure an unavailable SKU in your store to "show even if unavailable".
2 - for a valid XML integration config https://myaccountname.myvtex.com/admin/Site/XmlForm.aspx, set up the "Availability" tag and any availability tag to show.
3 - Use either a GET request or load the created XML URL in your browser.

The result will be an unavailable item, still showing in the XML, but without any price tags:

##

## Workaround


There is no workaround. The only option to not integrate items without price is to turn off the "showIfNotAvailable" option.
