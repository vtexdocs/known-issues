## Summary


It is not possible to change the order of specification values for accounts with a large volume of values. When the order of some value is changed, the page reloads and the change is not saved



## Simulation



1. From the side menu, click Catalog.
2. Click Categories.
3. Click a category that has registered product fields that were not inherited from another category.
4. Access Actions > Field (Product) or Field (SKU).
5. Click Values and change the order of values by the sort icon
6. Note that the change was not saved



## Workaround


Within Admin, there is no workaround

In the storefront, you can apply customizations to change the order
