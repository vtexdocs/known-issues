## Summary


When creating a service the merchant can choose if is going to be a mandatory field at the checkout or not.
However, currently this functionality is not working as expected. Even when the mandatory field is flagged as true, the product can be purchased without adding it on the checkout.


##

## Simulation



1. Create a service as mandatory;
2. Associate to an sku;
3. Check that at the checkout the service can be added or removed without problems.


##

## Workaround
