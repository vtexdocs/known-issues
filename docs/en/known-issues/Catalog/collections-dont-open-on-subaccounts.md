## Summary

When trying to open a collection on the new collections module of a subaccount, an error "Sorry, an unknown error occurred." is returned.

## Simulation

1. Enter a subaccount;
2. Go to the new collections module;
3. Try to open any collection;
4. Check that an error has occurred.
5. Access the same collection, but on the main account, it will render normally.

## Workaround

Open the collection on the main account and perform the changes or use the legacy collections module on _**Storefront -> Layout**_
