## Summary


When trying to open a collection on the new collections module of a subaccount an error "Sorry, an unknown error occurred." is returned.


##

## Simulation



1. Enter a subaccount;
2. Go to the new collections module;
3. Try to open any collection;
4. Check that an error has ocurred.


##

## Workaround



Since the catalog is shared between accounts, open the collection on the main account OR use the old collections module on the CMS.
