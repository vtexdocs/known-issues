## Summary



Currently, the loyalty value under the settings tab of the legacy CMS is not blocking/allowing the usage of such feature on the loyalty module.




##

## Simulation


Go to mystore.myvtex.com/admin/Site/ConfigForm.aspx

There's a reward program checkbox under this tab

 ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vtexdocs/help-center-content/refs/heads/main/docs/en/known-issues/Catalog/cms-loyalty-value-settings-not-working_1.png)

Even with it unchecked, if you configure a reward promotion or a value directly on a product, the credits will be given to the purchase, ignoring this setting on the admin.
