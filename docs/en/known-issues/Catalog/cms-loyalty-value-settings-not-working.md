## Summary



Currently, the loyalty value under the settings tab of the legacy CMS is not blocking/allowing the usage of such feature on the loyalty module.




#### Simulation


Go to mystore.myvtex.com/admin/Site/ConfigForm.aspx

There's a reward program checkbox under this tab

Even with it unchecked, if you configure a reward promotion or a value directly on a product, the credits will be given to the purchase, ignoring this setting on the admin.
