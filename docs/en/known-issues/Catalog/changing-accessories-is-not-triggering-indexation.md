## Summary


When the merchant makes changes or adds new accessories to the sku, the indexer is not being triggered automatically.

This makes the changes not reflect at the UI until another action triggers the indexer.


##

## Simulation


Make a change or add a accessories to a sku.
Check (after cache time) that the PDP does not update automatically.
Make another change on the sku.
Check (after cache time) that the PDP will reflect both changes.


##

## Workaround


Force the indexer by making another action on the sku.
