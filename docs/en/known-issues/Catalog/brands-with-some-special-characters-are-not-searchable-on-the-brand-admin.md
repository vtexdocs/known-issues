## Summary


The brand UI, `.myvtex.com/admin/Site/Marca.aspx`, doesn't allow users to search for brands with some special characters in the name, such as apostrophes `'`. Additionally, letters from non-Latin alphabets are also not searchable, for example from the Polish alphabet such as `Ż`.


#### Simulation


- Search for any brand with apostrophes on the brand UI;
- The Search will not find brands with apostrophes.


#### Workaround


There is no workaround.
