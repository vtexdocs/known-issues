## Summary


The button to delete products on the catalog is not working, it simply doesn't recognize any user clicks

 ![](https://vtexhelp.zendesk.com/attachments/token/ZR7ogOzhfLN3yC61V9RzTMRlZ/?name=inline-652081372.png)

This action might work if the product was just created and no skus, images or any other kind of data is associated with it.


#### Simulation


- Go to the catalog main page;
- Try to delete a product: no action will be triggered




#### Workaround


There is no way to delete only a single product, only the entire base. To achieve the same result as a deletion, try replacing this product with data you'd already use for a new product anyway.
