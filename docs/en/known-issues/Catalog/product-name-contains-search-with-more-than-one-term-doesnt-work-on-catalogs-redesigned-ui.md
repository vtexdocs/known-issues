## Summary


On the redesigned product list in the catalog, one of the search fields is "Product name contains". Currently, when searching for a product name with more than one term, two situations can happen:

- it returns any product that has any of the terms
- it doesn't return the product with the exact name searched


##

## Simulation


Search for a product name with two or more terms on a redesigned catalog and note that it can be returned products that contain only one of the terms


##

## Workaround


Use the "SKU name" search or the other search options available
