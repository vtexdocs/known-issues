## Summary


When the merchant performs an action on the Messages app in order to have some product data translated on the frontend, this action is not being actually reflected.


##

## Simulation



1. Make a change on the messages app;
2. Check on the indexInfo if the field GenerateAndSaveTranslationsDocument is set as 'false'
3. Do not reindex the product;
4. Check that the change did not reflected on the translated website.


##

## Workaround


In order to force the translations to appear is necessary to reindex the product. One of the following actions should do the trick:

- Change the name;
- Change the keywords;
- Change the Text;
- Change the category;
- Change the brand;
- Change the Active flag.
