## Summary


Change of availability of a seller in a commercial policy is not being correctly recognized in the catalog. This can cause two scenarios: a product from an unselected seller becomes available or a product from a selected seller becomes unavailable



## Simulation


Scenario 1
- Remove a seller from a commercial policy via the UI `/admin/Site/StoreForm.aspx?Id={{SC}}`
- Check by route `http://portal.vtexcommercestable.com.br/api/seller-register/pvt/sellers/?an=` if the trade policy was removed from the field _availableSalesChannel_

Scenario 2
- Add a seller of a trade policy via the UI
- Check by route `http://portal.vtexcommercestable.com.br/api/seller-register/pvt/sellers/?an=`if the trade policy is available from the field _availableSalesChannel_



## Workaround


Save the trade policy settings again from the UI
