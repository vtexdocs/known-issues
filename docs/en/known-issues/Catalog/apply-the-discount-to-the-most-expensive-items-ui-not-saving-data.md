## Summary


When using the promotions UI, manually attempting to save the "Apply to the most expensive items" option will not work and the selector will remain at the cheapest type option.

##

## Simulation


1 - Go to the promotions User Interface: https://account_name.myvtex.com/admin/promotions

2 - In the promotions UI, select the option to "Apply the discount to the most expensive items"

3 - Save the promotion

4 - Access it once again, the box to apply for the cheapest option will be selected instead.


##

## Workaround


Use the promotions save API instead https://developers.vtex.com/docs/api-reference/promotions-and-taxes-api#post-/api/rnb/pvt/calculatorconfiguration
