## Summary


When importing product specifications, the types with pre-registered values (such as Checkbox or Radio) trigger the product's indexation, but when the type is "Text" the same does not occur.


##

## Simulation



- Register a field with the type text within the category
- Import a file filled with a new value
- Note that the value will be updated in the Admin, but the product won't be reindexed


##

## Workaround


Configure this type of field through Admin or API
