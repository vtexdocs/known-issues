## Summary


Eventually, depending on the number of products that we have inside a category, if we select the categories filters on the legacy collection UI, it may return products that do not belong to these categories.


##

## Simulation



- Create a collection using the legacy collection UI;
- Insert products using the categories filter, the categories should have a large number of products.
- The collection sometimes may have products that do not belong to this category.


##

## Workaround



- On the legacy Collection UI, create a filter to remove the category from this product.
