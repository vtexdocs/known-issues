## Summary


Catalog Facets API described here: https://developers.vtex.com/docs/api-reference/search-api#get-/api/catalog_system/pub/facets/search/-term-
The response objects have the field "Slug", "Link" and "LinkEncoded". However, these fields should have the same format, but they diverge on the PriceRanges object when the value has decimal cases.

Example:
Slug: "de-100-a-199.99"
Link: "/category-test/de-100-a-199-99?map=c,priceFrom"

The Slug has the character "." while the Link has the character "-".



##

## Simulation



1. Have a category with a priceRange with decimal values.
2. Request the facets API
3. Check that the characters are different.


##

## Workaround
