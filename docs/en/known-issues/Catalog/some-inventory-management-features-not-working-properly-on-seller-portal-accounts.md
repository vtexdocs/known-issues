## Summary


Inventory Management features (like the links to the products) does not behave as expected on seller portal accounts. This happens because these kind of accounts use a different version of the catalog.

The Logistics module use on this UI an API from catalogV1.

However, we don't have a proxy from seller portal catalog to this API on catalogV1.

The impact is that the links provided on the products do not open the catalog page, but instead it returns an error.


##

## Simulation



1. Try to open the links to the products on a seller portal inventory management.

## Workaround
