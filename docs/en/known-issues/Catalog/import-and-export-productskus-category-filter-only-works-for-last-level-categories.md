## Summary


To reduce the amount of skus exported on the Product/Skus spreadsheet the client can use the filters.

The category filter is not working as expected when using categories that are not on the last level (categories that have child categories).

The result is that the spreadsheet is not being filtered at all, all the skus still remain.

When using categories of the last level the behavior is correct.



## Simulation



1. Go to Import and export -> Product and Skus;
2. Select a last level category on the filter;
3. Export the spreadsheet and verify that the result is filtered correctly by the category.
4. Select the parent category on the filter;
5. Export the spreadsheet and verify that the result is all the skus.



## Workaround


Select the last level category or other filter fields to reduce the amount of skus.
