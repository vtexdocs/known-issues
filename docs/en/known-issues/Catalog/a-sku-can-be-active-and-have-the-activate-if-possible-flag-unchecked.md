## Summary


It is expected that an active SKU has the "activate if possible" flag checked, however, this is not always the case.
A SKU can be active and have the "activate if possible" flag unchecked.


##

## Simulation


Open the SKU admin
See in the form that the SKU is active and the "activate if possible" flag is unchecked


##

## Workaround


Save the SKU directly through the admin
