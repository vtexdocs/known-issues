## Summary


Despite the success message on the Admin of the images spreadsheet being processed and that soon will be sent to the email, the report never actually arrives.
This behavior happens due to a timeout depending if the amount of skus being exported exceeds the 10k suggested limit.



## Simulation



1. Try to export a images spreadsheet report with more than 10.000 skus;
2. Verify that the message on the admin is successful;
3. Verify if the email actually arrives.



## Workaround


Use APIs to get the necessary information:
