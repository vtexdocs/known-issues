## Summary


Currently we have an issue affecting only a specific use case of Collections feature, when the client has over millions products/SKUs in their catalog, the **search bar for Collections** presents a timeout when searching for a product.


#### Simulation


1 step: Go to collections feature
2 step: Filter for a specific product you need to search using the search bar
3 step: If the accounts has over millions products a timeout will be shown in the screen


#### Workaround


For accounts having over millions products, either the + icon to add products, or the filters can be used to reduce impact in the search, or even using the spreadsheet to import new products to collection is working as expected.
