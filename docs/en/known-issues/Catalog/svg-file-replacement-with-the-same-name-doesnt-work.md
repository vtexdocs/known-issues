When using the CMS file manager in the account admin, there is an option for you to upload files:

When upload .SVG files, if you choose to replace an older file, by using the same name, the following display will be prompted:

However, the content of such file is never updating when using this method.


#### Simulation


1 - Get 2 .SVG files with the same name.
2 - upload file #1 and check its content
3 - upload file #2 and check its content, even after days, it will not have been overwritten.


#### Workaround


Delete the former file before uploading again.
