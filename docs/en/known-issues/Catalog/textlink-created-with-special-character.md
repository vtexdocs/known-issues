## Summary


When a product has specific special characters in the name, such as ®, the `textlink` is created with that character in the URL.



## Simulation



- Register a product with ® in the name.
- See the generated textlink



## Workaround


Do not use characters such as ® in the product name
Or change the textlink after the product has been created
