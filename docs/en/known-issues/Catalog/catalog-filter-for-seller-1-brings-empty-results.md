## Summary


Currently, when filtering exclusively for the main seller on the Catalog menus, no results are shown. This happens because this filter is incorrectly searching for a specific seller when, instead, the seller = 1 (the account's main seller) is the marketplace itself.



##

## Simulation



1. Go to any catalog menu, such as Import/Export
2. Filter for the main seller of the account:

3. No results will be shown


##

## Workaround


Using a trade policy in which only the seller 1 is present, filter for this given trade policy instead and consequently, you'll be filtering for the main seller.
