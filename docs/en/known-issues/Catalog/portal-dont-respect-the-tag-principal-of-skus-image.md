## Summary


A store needs to configure the **Principal** image regardless of the order in which it was loaded into the system. Currently the system does not respect the **Principal** tag and ends up taking the first registered image as the main one.



##

## Simulation



1. Configure two imagens in the SKU.

2. Try to change de main image since the button **Principal** in the list of images.

3. Look in the store front if the change works.



##

## Workaround


Always set the image you want to Main as the first registered image for the SKU. It involves more work on having to erase the images and reload them.
