## Summary


Products with mandatory specifications are not supposed to be active if at least one of these specifications are not filled or checked.

Creating the product via Admin guarantees a validation by the catalog about these specifications and the result is that the product remains inactive until they are filled.

However, such validation is not occurring when creating the product via API. The result is that the product can be active even without those specifications being filled.



## Simulation





1. Create a product via API: https://developers.vtex.com/vtex-rest-api/reference/post-product
2. Select a category that has mandatory product specifications
3. Do not fulfill the mandatory specifications
4. Verify that the product has status "Active" when it shouldn't have.



## Workaround





No workaround.
