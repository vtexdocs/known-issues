## Summary

Often, when attempting to save data for a collection group using the legacy collections application, under the path /admin/a and attempting to Save Group, the user will, in cases of large catalogs (large amount of categories, brands, products), face a timeout error message and won't be able to save their changes.

## Simulation


1. Go to the CMS UI application using a store that has a large catalog base, for instance, >10000 products.
2. Go to "Product Clusters (Collections) and select "_new group_"
3. Create a group and then select a few checkboxes in the form
4. Attempt to save these changes
5. If the request takes longer than 50 seconds to save, which is often the case in accounts with a large amount of data, the request will be stopped by and the data will not be saved.

## Workaround


Either using the new collections Admin OR using our [Collections API endpoints](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/api-reference/catalog-api#post-/api/catalog/pvt/collection).
