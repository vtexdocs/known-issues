## Summary


On Collections (Beta), we should be able to change the order of the products inside a collection using the feature "Move to Position":

https://help.vtex.com/tutorial/creating-collections-beta--yJBHqNMViOAnnnq4fyOye

However, this feature fails intermittently and does not work properly all the time.


##

## Simulation


- Go to any collection settings admin: `.myvtex.com/admin/collections`
- Try to change the order of a Product inside the collection;
- Wait until the product is automatically reindexed with the new order on the collection.



##

## Workaround


There is no workaround in Collections (Beta), but manually setting the order of products is possible in Collections created through the legacy CMS (Portal) with some restrictions:
