## Summary


Currently the SKU Catalog APIs are not returning correctly the name of a service type. Instead is being returned the name of the service value.


##

## Simulation



1. Make a GET SKU request on a sku associated with a service: https://developers.vtex.com/docs/api-reference/catalog-api#get-/api/catalog/pvt/stockkeepingunit/-skuId-
2. Note that the services object returns a serviceTypeId field and a Name, however the Name field is not showing the service type name itself.
