## Summary


When using the collections module and attempting to export registers, if the listed product in a given collection has all of its skus set as inactive, the exported sheet will only list 1 of the product's skus, instead of all.


##

## Simulation


1 - Get a product that has multiple skus and set all of them to inactive.
2 - Insert them into a catalog collection /admin/collections
3 - use the export feature
4 - only the uppermost SKU of the product will be listed in the sheet, instead of all
