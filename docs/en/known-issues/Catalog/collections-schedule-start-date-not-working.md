## Summary


Currently, when the start date of a scheduled collection is reached, the process of reindexing the products in it is not triggered, that is, the start date scheduling does not work as a whole. As a consequence, the products are not indexed in the collection on the configured date.



## Simulation


1) Create a new collection either via the new collections admin module or the legacy CMS collections

2) Set a start date for this specific collection to initiate a few minutes ahead of the current date

3) Insert 1+ products into this collection and save it

4) The product will not be reindexed and consequently not be added to the given collection.




## Workaround


Manually reindex the products or access the collection from the legacy CMS and save the inclusion group and the collection again.
