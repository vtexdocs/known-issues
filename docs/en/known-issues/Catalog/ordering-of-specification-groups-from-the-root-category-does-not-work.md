## Summary


Currently, when specification groups are created in the root category, it is not possible to reorder them by Admin or API



## Simulation



1. Create two specification groups in the root category
2. See that you cannot change the order by Admin, despite the message that it is possible
3. Try changing the order using the Update Specification Group route (`api/catalog_system/pvt/specification/group`)
4. Note that the position field in the response is not changed



## Workaround


N/A
