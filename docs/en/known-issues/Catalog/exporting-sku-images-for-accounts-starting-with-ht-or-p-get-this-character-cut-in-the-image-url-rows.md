## Summary


The SKU image report, /admin/Site/ProdutoImagemExportacao.aspx, for accountnames that start with "h", "t" or "p", such as "testaccount", wil lshow a missing character in the export sheeto for the imageURL row.


##

## Simulation


1 - for an account that starts with the mentioned initial characters, go to /admin/Site/ProdutoImagemExportacao.aspx and export a sheet for any sku that has at least 1 image.
2 - open the exported sheet and check the column "UrlImagem": it'll be without the initial character

For instance, if the account is named "testaccount":

##

## Workaround


Create a subaccount starting with another character (for instance, "mytestaccount") and access the export UI using this subaccount. The export then  will show the whole URL string without any incorrect trims.
