## Summary


Some words are ignored by the search, in the case of "é", the term should be converted to "e" and then ignored by the search. But a search with that term will return an empty search.



## Simulation



- Register a product with "é" in the name or substitute word
- Search for product name or substitute word.
- See that you will be redirected to an empty search



## Workaround


N/A
