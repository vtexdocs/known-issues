## Summary


Currently, the sales app can face a problem in loading pages properly for products in which the "description" product field also has the word "description" itself registered in it.


##

## Simulation


1 - for a sales app account, create a product and fields for it, in them, add the word "description" to it.

2 - navigate through search result pages that contain this given product as a result, a "error loading search" error will be displayed.


##

## Workaround


remove the "description" string and replace it for something similar, such as productDescription.
