## Summary



These 3 kinds of crossSelling APIs:  Who Saw Also Saw, Who Saw Also Bought and Who Bought Also Bought not always bring the results of the products that should be recommended. Sometimes the results are random products from the same category as the original product.


##

## Simulation



1. Visit two products from different categories on the site; (or visit one and buy another / or buy the two of them separately)
2. Use one of the APIs above and verify the response result;
3. Check that the products returned are do not contain the other one you visited, instead are just other products from the same category as the first one.


##

## Workaround


There is no workaround.
