## Summary


When using the create or update product APIs in the catalog application: https://developers.vtex.com/docs/api-reference/catalog-api#post-/api/catalog/pvt/product and sending the field releaseDate as null, in its value, it is created with the current date instead.


##

## Simulation


1 - Create or update a new product, in your store, via the mentioned API, passing, in its request body, the releaseDate field as a null.
2 - Access the catalog admin UI or use a GET in the same API path to fetch the sent data
3 - The releaseDate field will be displaying the sent date's value instead of a null.
