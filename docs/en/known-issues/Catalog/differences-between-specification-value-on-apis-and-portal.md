## Summary



Currently these two APIs ("api/catalog" and "api/catalog_system" GET Specification Value) are consulting different tables on the catalog database. The values are supposed to be the same on both tables, however scenarios with special characters may diverge.

This also reflects on the Portal and PDPs, since the information is being generated based on the wrong table. The special characters appear as "????" on the frontend.


##

## Simulation



1. Have a specification value with a special characters;
2. Check the results on the "api/catalog" and "api/catalog_system" APIs;
3. Check the PDP information;
4. Verify if they were equal.

## Workaround
