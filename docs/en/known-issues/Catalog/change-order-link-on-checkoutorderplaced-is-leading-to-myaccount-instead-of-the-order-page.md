## Summary


When the account has setup the possibility of the shopper changing the order by themselves the change order link will appear on the checkout/orderPlaced template.

However, this link is not redirecting the customer to the edit page, but to the myAccount, which appears empty.



##

## Simulation


Setup the Allow customers to make changes to orders flag on Admin -> settings -> order settings

The shopper fulfills an order and goes to the checkout/orderPlaced

Check that the link will not redirect them to the order edit area.


##

## Workaround



1. The shopper has to click on My Orders in the myAccount section;
2. Choose again the order they want to change;
3. Click on change order.
