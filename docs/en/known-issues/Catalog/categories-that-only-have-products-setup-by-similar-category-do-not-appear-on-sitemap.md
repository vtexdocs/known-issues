## Summary


A product can have a category setup and a similar category setup. With that, an URL for the similar category will be available on the frontend showing this particular product.

For scenarios that the only products of the category are setup by this "similar category" workflow, the sitemap won't show the category.


##

## Simulation



1. Create a new category
2. Insert products to it only via "similar category"
3. Check that the category is not presented at the sitemap


##

## Workaround


N/A
