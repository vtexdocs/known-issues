## Summary


When attempting to export Product Specifications from the "Import and Export" UI, if there is any null value or null relation on the category to be exported, the process will fail with an "Index out of Range" message. In other words, the category must have registered directly at its level a product field, products, and products with values associated.



##

## Simulation


1) Go to the Product Specification export UI: ProdutoExportacaoImportacaoEspecificacaoV2.aspx

2) Right-click a category in which there's no product specification field registered

3) An error message of "Index out of bonds" will be prompted.





##

## Workaround


Either export the desired category's parent or child

or

Use the get product specifications API to fetch data: https://developers.vtex.com/vtex-rest-api/reference/catalog-api-product-specification
