## Summary


Currently, the legacy catalog search has a functionality, in the "Advanced search" tab that allows you to import a file to create a search filter.

However, this import currently is not properly filtering data and ends up simply not adding any parameters to be filtered for in the catalog.


##

## Simulation


1 - In the catalog module, go to any UI that has a filtering feature available, such as /admin/Site/Relatorio_Skus.aspx

2 - In the brand section, click the "Advanced Search Button"

4 - attempt importing a file with a brand list, the said list will not be added to the filters.

## Workaround


Perform other filters when searching for products in the legacy catalog module.
