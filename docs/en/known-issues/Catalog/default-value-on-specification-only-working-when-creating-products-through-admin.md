## Summary


When creating a specification on a VTEX Category you can setup a default value that will be filled when the sku/product is created without this information.

However, this feature is not behaving as expected when the sku/product is created using API or spreadsheet. The field remains empty.

When creating the sku/product via Admin UI, the default value works normally.



## Simulation



1. Create a specification with a default value;
2. Create a product through Admin without fulfilling this field;
3. Verify that the field value is the default value;
4. Create a product through API or spreadsheet;
5. Verify that the field value is empty;



## Workaround


Create the product using Admin.
