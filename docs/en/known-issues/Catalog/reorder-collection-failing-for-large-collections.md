## Summary


In the new collections admin UI, when a user tries to reorder the product order display, the catalog GraphQL mutation that performs this action often fails


##

## Simulation


1) Check a collection in the Collection Module with 1000+ SKUs
2) Try executing the reordering drag and drop action
3) See that an error message will be prompted



##

## Workaround


There are no workarounds (would be creating a new collection in the correct order, but it is not a workaround by itself, just an alternative).
