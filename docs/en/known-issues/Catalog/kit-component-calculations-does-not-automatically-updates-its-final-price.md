## Summary


Currently, some accounts, when attempting to update component prices for a kit, will not experience the final kit price being automatically calculated and updated when changing said prices.


#### Simulation


This issue only happens with some accounts. For them, simply changing a component price without seeing it reflected directly in the kit price is sufficient to say you are affected by this KI.


#### Workaround


Update the SKU Kit price directly, calculating the final price, rather than updating it individually using the components.
