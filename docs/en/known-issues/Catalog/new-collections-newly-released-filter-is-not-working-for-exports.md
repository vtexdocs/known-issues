## Summary


The "Recently Released" product filter in the new collections module fetches products that were set with the release date variable in the recent past. It is present in the following UI component:

 ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vtexdocs/help-center-content/refs/heads/main/docs/en/known-issues/Catalog/new-collections-newly-released-filter-is-not-working-for-exports_1.png)

However, when combining this functionality with the sheet export, this filter is ignored, bringing all the products within the collection.






## Simulation


1 - Go to the new collections module and choose a collection

2 - On the main collection listing, use the "Newly Released" filter, note that you need to have at least 1 product with the "Release Date" value set in the filtered range. This value can be set on the Product Configuration page.

3 - A given value of "Newly Released" products will be filtered and listed on the UI.

4 - Select the "Export" functionality

5 - Export a SKU sheet for this collection

6 - Chech the number of exported registers, it will be the total amount of products in the collection, not the Newly Released.






## Workaround


Use alternative filters for your export.
