## Summary



On the XML we have the fields called "Product Name" and "Product Name + Sku Name". However, if the product only has 1 sku, the field "Product Name" is not behaving as expected, being filled as "Product Name + Sku Name".

For example, if the product name A has a single SKU(Name B), the **Product Name** Field would use A+B, instead of just A.




## Simulation



1. Create a XML;
2. Add a product with only 1 sku;
3. Check the Product Name field;
4. Verify that the return will be the name of the product added to the name of the sku.



## Workaround


No workaround.
