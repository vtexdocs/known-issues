## Summary


Currently, the catalog sheet for Products and SKUs is not supporting the 'lb' measurement unit. `/admin/Site/Relatorio_Skus.aspx`

This is actually a lb unit in our SKU UI which is configurable:

However, the product&sku import currently returns an error message whenever an user tries to import any sku containing this value, regardless if the other fields are valid:

## Simulation


1) Set 'lb' as the measurement unit of an sku

2) Export a products and skus sheet for this filtered sku

3) Try importing again making a minor change on, let's say, the sku name. You'll receive the error.







## Workaround


Setting the values via API and/or directly via admin.
