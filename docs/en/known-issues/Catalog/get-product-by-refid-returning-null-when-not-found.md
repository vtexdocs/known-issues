## Summary


The get product by refid route (/catalog_system/pvt/products/productgetbyrefid) is returning a null instead of a simply 404 response when not finding a valid id on a given store's catalog




#### Simulation


1) Run the following cURL

curl --location --request GET 'https://mystore.vtexcommercestable.com.br/api/catalog_system/pvt/products/productgetbyrefid/667' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--header 'Cookie: janus_sid=beb23e63-ccb5-4619-9ee7-f1f61deb0683'

You should get the following response if the given id doesn't exist

This is incorrect since the expected is a `404 - Not Found`




#### Workaround


Using other APIs for GET product such as Get Product by ID if this 404 response is imperative for anything you're working with.
