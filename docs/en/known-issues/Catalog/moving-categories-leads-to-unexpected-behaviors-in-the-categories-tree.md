## Summary


Presently, this functionality can lead to inconsistencies in your category treeâ€™s databank, depending on the movement type. This functionality is therefore not recommended until it can be remedied.
The following inconsistencies were identified as a result of this problem:

- Duplicated product specifications/SKUs
- Category and subcategory are not inheriting department specifications
- Side filter ordering is incorrect




## Simulation


There is no simulation.



## Workaround



1. Disable the current category you wish to move
2. Create a new category in the desired location
3. Move the products to the newly created category
