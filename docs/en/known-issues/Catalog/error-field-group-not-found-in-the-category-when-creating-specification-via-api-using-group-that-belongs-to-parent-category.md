## Summary


Is possible to create a specification using the following API:
https://developers.vtex.com/docs/api-reference/catalog-api#post-/api/catalog/pvt/specification

The field "FieldGroupId" is the ID of the group of specifications that contains the new specification. However, when the group belongs to a parent category, not the category used for creating the specification, the error Field Group not found in the category is returned.


##

## Simulation



1. Create a group category on a Parent category
2. Use the API above to create a new specification on a child category
3. Fill the field FieldGroupId with the groupId from the parent category
4. Check that the error appears.


##

## Workaround


Create the specification via UI, create the specification on the parent category or create a group on the child category to use.
