## Summary


It is expected to use the admin without restrictions. However, sometimes a **Something Went Wrong** error is displayed in the catalog admin.


##

## Simulation



1. Open the Catalog admin
2. Open a section of the catalog, for example: `/admin/Site/ValeForm.aspx`, `Product.aspx` , `ProdutoCategoriaSimilarForm.aspx` or `SkuForm.aspx`
3. Receive a **Something Went Wrong** error on the admin


##

## Workaround



- Try to use the legacy admin: `.vtexcommercestable.com.br/admin`
- Try to reload the page a few times, or
- Try to wait for a few minutes and access the page again
