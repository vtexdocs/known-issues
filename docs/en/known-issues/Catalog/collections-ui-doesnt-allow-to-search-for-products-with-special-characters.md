## Summary


The new collections UI, `.myvtex.com/admin/collections`, does not allow users to search for products with special characters.



## Simulation



- Search for any product with apostrophes, quotation marks, dots... on the collections UI when adding products to the collection;
- The Search will not find products with special characters;



## Workaround


- Search for products names before the special character (example: can't type `'` on the search);
- Add products to Collections using API;
- Add products to Collections using Legacy Collections UI.
