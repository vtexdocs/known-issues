## Summary


On the specification fields page, our legacy admin has a "remove" button that does not work, this action is not available to the store.



## Simulation


1) Go to any store's category tree
2) Go to groups --> fields
3) Try executing the "remove" action on the button
4) Nothing will happen



## Workaround


Inactivating the field and/or creating a new category without the given fields.
