## Summary


Google recently updated its taxonomy categories, called the global category in VTEX. However, comparing the categories described in the Google file and within the VTEX catalog, you can see that our reference is outdated.


##

## Simulation



1. Go to the edit category page
2. Click on the field "Select VTEX global category"
3. Search for example "Deodorant & Anti-Perspirant"
4. See that when accessing the google file by URL there are categories below, such as "Deodorant", but in our reference, the last category is "Deodorant & Anti-Perspirant"


##

## Workaround


We suggest that clients use the higher-level categories for the moment
