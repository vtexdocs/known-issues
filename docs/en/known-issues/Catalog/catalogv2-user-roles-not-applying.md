## Summary


Currently, the user role UI for the CatalogV2 application is not correctly applying the user permissions of access control when an user is utilizing the UI to create/read/update products.







## Simulation


1) Access the license manager UI for a store that has the CatalogV2 installed (/admin/license-manager/#/role-details)

2) Set a read-only user role

 ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vtexdocs/known-issues/refs/heads/main/docs/en/known-issues/Catalog/catalogv2-user-roles-not-applying_1.png)

3) With these rules set, log in with the related user

4) Try to update a product, you will be able to, despite the read-only credentials.







## Workaround


Use the GraphQL APIs of the catalog v2 to manage these permissions.
