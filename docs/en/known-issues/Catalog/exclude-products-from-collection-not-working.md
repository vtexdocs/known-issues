## Summary


The account can create collections using the legacy version and add entire collections and brands.

However, when trying to exclude some products of these collection or brands using the "exclusao" subcollection nothing happens. Despite no error messages appear, the skus continue to be on the collection.


##

## Simulation



1. Create a collection and add a category on the "Inclusão" subcollection group.
2. Create a "exclusão" subcollection group with at leat one product (all skus) on the add skus part.
3. Check that the sku continues to be on the collection;
