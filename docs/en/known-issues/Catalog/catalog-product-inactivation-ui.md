## Summary


Currently the new catalog UI has an issue with product inactivation usability, that basically consists in the scenario where the merchant wants to inactivate the product but the catalog keeps the SKU status as active, causing active SKUs but with inactive products to display in the website.


#### Simulation



Inactive a product that has active SKUs, by doing that the catalog will keep the SKUs status as active.


#### Workaround


Whenever the whole product including their SKUs wants to be inactivated, the merchant needs to inactivate the SKUs
