## Summary


There are a lot of routes that support some type of value, but if the costumer uses another type of value (for example, insert null instead of boolean) can broke the product / SKU / category / brand interface. Denying the client to update the information through admin.



##

## Simulation


For the routes `api/catalog/pvt/brand?an=`or` /api/catalog/pvt/brand/?an=`, the documentation says that the field `MenuHome` only accepts boolean values. But if we send a request with "null" for example, the route will return a 200 and we are able ti insert this value. After this, if we try to edit the brand on the admin interface, we will not be able. It will return a Something Went Wrong error with the `exception_message="Object cannot be cast from DBNull to other types."`



##

## Workaround


Update the information again, through the API.
