## Summary


When you change the ordering of products or SKUs fields in a category other than the main one, after clicking the sort button the changes are not saved and the changed fields do not appear after the page is reloaded.



## Simulation



1. From the side menu, click Catalog.
2. Click Categories.
3. Click a category that has registered product fields that were not inherited from another category.
4. Access Actions > Field (Product) or Field (SKU).
5. In the box that contains the order number, change the order of some categories.
6. Click Sort.




## Workaround


Currently the only solution is to perform the ordering of the fields through a Javascript customization on the front-end.
