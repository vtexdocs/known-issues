## Summary


Currently, the computed price API has a prop named 'cost price' that on specific scenarios might show a 1 cent difference between its value on the UI and the computed prices API https://developers.vtex.com/docs/api-reference/pricing-api#get-/pricing/prices/-itemId-/computed/-priceTableId-


##

## Simulation


Set a product with a cost price of 67.82 and no markup.

Check the pricing UI and the response from this API, which should deliver:

Even though the correct value is 67.82

## Workaround


Setting fixed prices or a price rounding fixes it.
