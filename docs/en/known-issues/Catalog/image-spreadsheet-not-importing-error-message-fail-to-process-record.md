## Summary



Sometimes, when trying to import a image spreadsheet with URLs from vteximg.com.br or vtexassets.com that are set as "https://' instead of "http://" the import fails. The error message is:

`"Fail to process record. Make sure your worksheet data is consistent and try again. Error details: An error ocurred while sending the request."`

## Simulation



1. Try to import a spreadsheet using URLs from vteximg.com.br or vtexassets.com that contain https://...
2. Check that the import fails
3. Try to import the same spreadsheet using now http://
4. Check that the import works.

PS: If on step 4 the import still fails, check if the image is set as .jpg and try again.



## Workaround


Use URLs with http:// when the images are from vteximg.com.br or vtexassets.com
