## Summary


On the Collection Module, the Product Specifications filter is not working properly when the specification has the type "Text" and "Large Text". When this kind of specification is selected, a text box is opened to insert the possible values separated by a comma, tab, or enter. However, when typing only one character, the system assumes it as a value even without separating the terms.


##

## Simulation



1. Create a Product Specification with the type "Text"
2. Go to Collection Module, click on the "More" filter, select "Product Specification"
3. Localize the specification you've created and type anything, see that even one character will become a term of search


##

## Workaround


Continue to type until the term is completed and then delete the incorrect terms
