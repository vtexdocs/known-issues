## Summary


When requesting a second partial refund of the same value as the first, the gateway returns the following message:

    Message: Gift card has been already refunded.


Or if requesting a second partial cancellation with the same value as the first, the gateway returns:

    Message: "Gift card has been already cancelled"


Although this is logged in the interaction, the second refund/cancellation is not actually processed.
This scenario is much more common for the second refund/cancellation with the same value, but it can also occur in subsequent refunds, as long as the requested amount equals the sum of the already processed refunds.


#### Simulation



1. Make a purchase exclusively with a Gift Card (GC);
2. Finish the transaction;
3. Issue a partial refund for an amount less than half of the total payment;
4. Request another refund for the same amount as the first.


#### Workaround


For refund cases, please open a ticket with support to apply the internal workaround.
For cancellation cases, cancel manually with your provider.
