## Summary


Subaccounts are not automatically allocated to a cluster upon creation. As a result, masterdata search do not function correctly for these subaccounts.


#### Simulation



1. Create or access a subaccount that has not been manually allocated to a cluster.
2.

Attempt to call the Masterdata Search API, such as:

    GET https://..com/api/dataentities/CL/search?_fields=id
3. Observe that the response returns an 500 error indicating that the masterdata search is not functioning.


#### Workaround


The API from this documentation can also allocate an account to a cluster - Customer and address forms do not exist in multistores. To use it the user must have the resource ADMIN_DS on its role.
