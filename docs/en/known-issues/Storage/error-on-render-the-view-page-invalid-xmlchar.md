## Summary


When rendering the view page, an error `error on line ... at column ...: xmlParseCharRef: invalid xmlChar value ...` occurs. This error happens because the form contains a character not interpreted by the XML parser, causing the page to fail during rendering.

#### Simulation



1. Access the view page in the system.
2. Load a form containing a field with a character not supported by the XML parser.
3. On Chrome dev tools observe that the page fails to render and displays the following

    error: error on line ... at column ...: xmlParseCharRef: invalid xmlChar value ...



#### Workaround


Identify the field containing the unsupported character.
Remove the invalid character from the field's value using API.
Reload the page to verify that it renders correctly.
