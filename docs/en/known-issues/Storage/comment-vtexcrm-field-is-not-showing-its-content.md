## Summary



Currently, when saving data in the "Comentar" field in a Master Data form, the inputted comments are not being shown upon saving and refreshing the page.









## Simulation





1. Go to mystore.vtexcrm.com.br
2. Open a CL document (any will do)
3. Open the comment field

4. Try inserting any data in it and save
5. Refresh the page, nothing will be there, albeit the API is showing content.








## Workaround



Create a new field for this data entity as a text type and name it Comment.

Then insert it in the form and you will have a "clone" comment field that is functional.
