## Summary

The CNPJ and CPF field types are used amongst various parts of VTEX and they are essential fields present on the MasterData CL entity as well.

These fields must be formatted in a very specific manner and their special characters (such as "." and "/") are currently not compatible ith the search present in both the API ( ) and UI.

## Simulation

Go to your account's masterdata myaccount.vtexcrm.com.br
In the applications listing access your form for "Cleintes"
In the filters, search for "CNPJ"
Type a special character in your search, such as "/"
An "Erro Inesperado" window will pop up

## Workaround

Search using the "All" field or using double quotes ("00.000.000/0000-00") for the system to interpret the string or use alternative fields for searching or only aplhanumerical characters when searching with cpf and cnpf.
