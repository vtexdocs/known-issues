## Summary


Currently, for data entities with several fields, when there's an attempt to export a sheet and download it, both via email or directly via the UI, the download link does not save the file onto your browser.



##

## Simulation


1 - for a data entity in which you have several fields, try to export all of its fields at the same time or several registers

2 - the download link will not generate a file onto your browser

## Workaround


**Right-click on the Download link and copy the link, then paste the link in another tab and the download will start or** fetch data via API https://developers.vtex.com/docs/api-reference/masterdata-api#get-/api/dataentities/-acronym-/search and/or download data into several, smaller spreadsheets
