## Summary


The "All" filter in the CRM UI returns an error when used in entities with many documents. This occurs because the "All" filter performs a wildcard search across all searchable fields, which can result in an error due to the high volume of data being queried.

- Search for any term in the search field.
- Observe that the system attempts to perform a wildcard search on all searchable fields, which may result in an error due to the high volume of data.
