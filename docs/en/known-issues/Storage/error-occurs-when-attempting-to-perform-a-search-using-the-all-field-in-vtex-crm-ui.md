## Summary


The "All" filter in the CRM UI returns an error when used in entities with many documents. This occurs because the "All" filter performs a wildcard search across all searchable fields, which can result in an error due to the high volume of data being queried.

## Simulation



- Access the CRM UI `https://.vtexcrm.com.br/` and navigate to a view representing an entity with many records.
- Initiate a search using the "All" field. ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vtexdocs/known-issues/refs/heads/main/docs/en/known-issues/Storage/error-occurs-when-attempting-to-perform-a-search-using-the-all-field-in-vtex-crm-ui_2.png)
- Search for any term in the search field.
- Observe that the system attempts to perform a wildcard search on all searchable fields, which may result in an error due to the high volume of data.
