## Summary


When the customer makes a purchase, the author of the version is given an user id (guid) or a service, followed by the login/name/description "`Note: Not found on VTEX ID.`" on the profile.
This behavior does not impact the profile or shopper experience, once this is only about the UI, and it is possible to check the information by version API.

## Simulation

- Access CL (Clientes) Data Entity tab:
- Select a document and click on the eye icon to view the data;
- Click on "_Change Log_" button;
- Open a recent version;
- Check the "_Version author_", it will be an user id, and the name "`Note: Not found on VTEX ID.`", for example:
