## Summary


On the product page, some information about the product has HTML tags(<b>[...]</b>, <font>[...]</font>, <li>[...]</li> etc).


##

## Simulation



- Go to a store product page.
- Open the field about product information or specification.
- See that in some fields, there are HTML tags if the productForm at the admin was registered in this way.


##

## Workaround


The merchant can put the information without the HMTL tags, but this will change how the data is displayed in the online store.
