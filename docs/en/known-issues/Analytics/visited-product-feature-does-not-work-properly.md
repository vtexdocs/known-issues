## Summary


The visited product trigger, which uses the data captured by Request Capture, is configured with the "checkout" filter set to "null". However, Request Capture needs to go through the checkout to capture the user and navigation data and populate it in the Master Data. As a result, the trigger does not work properly because RC cannot populate the data before checkout.


##

## Simulation



1. Set up the trigger following the documentation: https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/configuring-product-visited--tutorials_3136
2. Navigate to a product page
3. Wait for at least 2h for the email to be sent


##

## Workaround


There is no workaround
