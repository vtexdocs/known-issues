## Summary

When filling in a company's data at checkout in Mexico, users can enter either a corporate RFC (Registro Federal de Contribuyentes, a tax identification number) or a personal RFC document. Either one should be enough to complete a purchase.

However, currently you can only complete a purchase on the platform if you enter the corporate RFC. This way, users cannot complete purchases if they only enter the personal RFC.


## Simulation

1. Access the website of a store set up for B2B sales in Mexico;
2. Add products to the shopping cart.
3. Proceed to checkout.
4. Enter only the personal RFC and note that it is not possible to complete the purchase.


## Workaround

Currently, there is no workaround for this scenario.
