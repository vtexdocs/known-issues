## Summary

When an item is removed from the order:
![item removido](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vtexdocs/help-center-content/refs/heads/main/docs/en/known-issues/Post-purchase/transactional-emails-dont-consider-items-removed-from-the-order_1.jpg)

The transactional email doesn't consider the removed item and shows both items in the email:
![email transacional](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vtexdocs/help-center-content/refs/heads/main/docs/en/known-issues/Post-purchase/transactional-emails-dont-consider-items-removed-from-the-order_2.jpg)



## Simulation

- Remove an item from the order alreay made.
- Check the transactional email on the order timeline.

## Workaround

Currently there is no workaround for this issue.
