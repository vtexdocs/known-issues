## Summary

In the order json, where all the information about purchases products is shown, when of these products is a KIT, only the KIT EAN is displayed, and not that of the components.

## Simulation

1. Register a product KIT;
2. Purchase this product;
3. Call the Order Management API by the order ID.

## Workaround

If the component SKU compenent EAN is indispensable to the ERP, the API call can be done using the SKU ID, whereas the answer sent to json would contain the EAN.
