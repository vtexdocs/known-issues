## Summary

The canceled order email - due to payment denied - is not sent. With that, the customer is not aware of the reason why the order was canceled.

## Simulation

To simulate the scenario, you need to use a store that has an antifraud system, make a test order, and ensure that it's denied. Only an email informing that the order has been canceled will be sent.

## Workaround

It is recommended that the canceled order email contain information to guide customers about order cancellations awaiting approval, informing them of the required procedures in case of payment denied.
