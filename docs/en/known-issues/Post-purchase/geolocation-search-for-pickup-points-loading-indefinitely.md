## Summary

At checkout, if the customer's location is obtained from the browser, the map keeps loading indefinitely. It displays the message "Awaiting permission to get your current location".


## Simulation

To simulate a scenario that requires changing the location identified by the browser, we recommend using the browser's override geolocation. If you are using Google Chrome, see the article [Chrome's override geolocation](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/device-mode/geolocation/).

After making sure your browser meets the said condition, follow the steps below:

1. Access the store.
2. Add products to the shopping cart.
3. Proceed to checkout.
4. Enable geolocation tracking in your browser.
5. At checkout, select the **pickup point** delivery option. 
6. Note that the page is stuck on loading, displaying the message "Awaiting permission to get your current location".
