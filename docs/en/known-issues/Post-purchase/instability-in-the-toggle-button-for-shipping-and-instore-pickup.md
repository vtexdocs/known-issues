## Summary

At checkout, if you select the shipping delivery option, enter your postal code and then toggle the button to pick up in store, and toggle the button to ship again, the postal code will not be saved, or a wrong postal code can be displayed instead.


## Simulation

1. Access the store.
2. Add products to the shopping cart.
3. Proceed to checkout.
4. In the delivery section, select the <i class="fas fa-toggle-on"></i> option to ship and enter the postal code. 
5. Toggle the <i class="fas fa-toggle-on"></i> button to pick up in store and select a location.
6. Toggle the <i class="fas fa-toggle-on"></i> button to ship again.
7. Check if the postal code you have entered has remained the same.

Note that we are describing a scenario of instability, so it will not happen in every simulation.


## Workaround

There is no workaround for this scenario.
