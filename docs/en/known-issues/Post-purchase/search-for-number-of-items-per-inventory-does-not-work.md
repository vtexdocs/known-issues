## Summary

In the __Inventory and shippping__ module, under the Inventory tab -> *Manage Items in Inventory*, you have the option to search by items in inventory. However, when trying this option, a message appears saying that no results were found (even when items are in stock). 

## Simulation

- In the __Inventory and shippping__ module, under the Inventory tab -> *Manage Items in Inventory*
- Insert a number that you know is in stock
- The results loads with the message "No results were found"

## Workaround

In this case, the workaround is controlling your inventory by spreadsheet:
- In the __Inventory and shippping__ module, access the *Dashboard* tab
- Download the warehouse spreadsheet, as explained in the article on how to [import and export the inventory spreadsheet](https://help.vtex.com/pt/tutorial/--tutorials_2034)
- In the spreadsheet itself, filter the number of items you wish to check
