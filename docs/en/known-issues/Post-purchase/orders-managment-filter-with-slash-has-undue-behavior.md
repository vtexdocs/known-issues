## Summary

When filtering by bank slip (boleto banc√°rio) with 7 days, 28 days, 30/60, 30/60/90 and clicking on one of the orders of the listing, after returning the filter to 30/60 and 30/60/90 the orders are automatically removed.


## Simulation

- Filter by the bank slip payment method: 7 days, 28 days, 30/60, 30/60/90
- Click on one of the orders displayed in the listing.
- Go back by clicking on Sales.
- The displayed filter will be 7 days and 28 days. The 30/60 and 30/60/90 ones will be automatically removed.

## Workaround

You can work it around by removing the bar (`/`) from the filters or by using the API to get the orders list:
