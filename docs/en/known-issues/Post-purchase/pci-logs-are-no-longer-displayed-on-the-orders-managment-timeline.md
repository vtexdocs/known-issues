## Summary

In the timeline, found in the order details (Orders Managment), the PCI information no longer appears.


## Simulation

- Select an old order (for instance, from June 2017).

![pedido com log pci](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vtexdocs/help-center-content/refs/heads/main/docs/en/known-issues/Post-purchase/pci-logs-are-no-longer-displayed-on-the-orders-managment-timeline_1.PNG)

- Compare it to a current order.
- See that the information on Anti-Fraud, for exmaple - which comes from the PCI module -, will not be displayed.

## Workaround

All information can be found by accessing the PCI module.
