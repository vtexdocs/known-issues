If the layout of the new My Orders presents problems in your store _out of the box_, without any customization, it may be that your store's CSS is interfering with it.

Some versions of Bootstrap add the CSS `html {font-size: 10px}`, which interferes with the sizes of the elements of the new My Orders.

## Simulation

1. Access `{STORENAME}.com/account/orders`;
2. See the orders list.

## Workaround

Customize your store's CSS with the CSS property `html { font-size: 16px }` in My Orders, to restore the elements original proportion.
