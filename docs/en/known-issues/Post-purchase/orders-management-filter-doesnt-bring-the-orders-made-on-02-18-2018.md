## Summary

When filtering in the Orders management by Order Date, selecting the date 02/18/2018, the filter automatically changes to the orders of 02/17/2018. With that, it's not possible to filter these orders.

## Simulation

- Access your store Orders management;
- Click on filters;
- Select the Order Date filter;
- Fill in the filter with the date 02/18/2018.

## Workaround

The orders can be queried using our GET ORDER API:
