## Summary


The tags registered at the pickup point are available in a dropdown in the shipping policies to link the PUP to the Shipping Policy, however when any of these tags are deleted in the PUP, they remain available in the dropdown within the shipping policy.


##

## Simulation


Register a tag in a PUP, check that it will be available in the shipping policy to link it to the PUP, then in the PUP itself delete the tag and check again in the shipping policy, the tag will still be there.


##

## Workaround


There is no workaround available
