## Summary


Update log in the inventory UI sometimes returns the error: Request failed with status code 500 for some specific SKUs, due to a timeout in the query to Analytics (where the data is stored), and no log for the SKU will be shown in the UI.

This timeout could be due a high volume of updates in the SKU, or any other factor that makes this query takes longer than the maximum time of 40s;


##

## Simulation


Due to the variable being the response time for the query to Analytics, it is not possible to replicate in a concise way.


##

## Workaround


There is no workaround available.
