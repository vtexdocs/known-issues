## Summary


Sometimes the shipping policy can be stuck in the processing status, but in the new logitics UI you can't see it because it informs you that the status is active.
This behavior can get in the way when uploading a new freight spreadsheet, as the user will assume that the process has been completed by displaying an active status, but the new data will not be reflected.



##

## Simulation


Have a shipping policy in active status in the new UI, where when trying to upload a new spreadsheet, the data is not reflected.



##

## Workaround


In order for the shipping policy to leave the processing status in which it is stuck, a team action is required, after which the spreadsheet can be uploaded and the process will continue as normal.
