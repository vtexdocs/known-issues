## Summary



SKU IDs with and without leading zero are causing confusion in inventory, and admin inconsistency. The SKU 0XXX has different quantities in the items list than when the SKU ID filter is applied with the same value (or XXX).

The logistics module handle the left zero as another SKU. So in that case the SKU 0XXX is not the XXX. And as another SKU has its own value in stock.




## Simulation


There is no way to simulate.
But you can see the sku with left zero on list and diferent values of stock when filter that sku on inventory.



## Workaround


There is no workaround for this divergence.
