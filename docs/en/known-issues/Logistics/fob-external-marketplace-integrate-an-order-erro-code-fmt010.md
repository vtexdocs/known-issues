## Simulation


It is possible to perform the simulation when trying to integrate with an (external) partner, with a Shipping Policy "Delivery" enabled, we will be successful, but when disabling this Shipping Policy we will have the error: "code": "FMT010".




## Workaround


For this case we have a Workaround which is the need to configure a Shipping Policy "Delivery".
