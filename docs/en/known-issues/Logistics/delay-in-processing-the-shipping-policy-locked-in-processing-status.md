## Summary


When uploading a spreadsheet and then click on "save changes" on the shipping policy configurations, the spreadsheet needs to be processed by our Logistics module. The processing time can vary depending on the size of the file, but it usually takes a few minutes. In some cases, the processing time can take up to a couple of hours or even days, and the status remains locked at "processing".
An important point is that this process does not impact the shipping policy availability while it is processing. The settings will be kept until the new one is finalized.



## Simulation


Unfortunately, there is no way to simulate this scenario.



## Workaround


One possible workaround is to upload the spreadsheet again. If the status still remains at "processing" for over an hour after the re-upload, please open a ticket to the VTEX Support.
