## Summary


When you delete a pickup point that is linked to a warehouse (inStore warehouse), the pickup point remains linked to the warehouse if you query it via API.



## Simulation


To simulate this behavior, we must:

- Create a pickup point;
- Link this pickup point to a warehouse;
- Delete the pickup point;
- Query (via API) the warehouse, and verify that the pickup point is still linked to the `pickuPointIds`.



## Workaround


As a workaround, you can remove this pickup point from the warehouse via Create/update warehouse API.
