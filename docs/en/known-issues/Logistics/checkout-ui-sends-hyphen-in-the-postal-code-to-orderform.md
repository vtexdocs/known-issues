## Summary


Checkout UI sends a hyphen for the postal code to orderForm, causing issues calculating SLAs when a country has 7 digits + the hyphen. This happens because the Logistics module considers the hyphen as a digit and depending on how the shipping rates were registered in the shipping policy.

Portugal and Japan are the only ones in this scenario.


##

## Simulation



- Have an account for Portugal or Japan;
- After adding products to the cart, type the postal code;
- The product may be shown as unavailable.


##

## Workaround



- Review the shipping rates to include a broader range.
