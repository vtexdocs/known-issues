## Summary



Currently in our native Mercado Livre integration, we are not bringing the BillingAddress provided by MELI. Some sellers need that information inside the OMS Get Orders, in order to send the correct values to MELI in the invoice flow.


##

## Simulation



Inside OMS GET Order we are currently only bringing the shippingAddress, and not the BillingAddress, this can be seen inside the GET Order API


##

## Workaround
