## Summary


Some skus are being integrated with specifications from another Marketplace.



## Simulation


For example, when integrating our catalog in magalu, we send everything that has specification, when magalu in its internal mechanism understands that there is an error it inactivates the ad.

Example specification being sent to Magalu

## Workaround


Manually the client can delete the specification, but our integration in a re-index overwrites the change made
