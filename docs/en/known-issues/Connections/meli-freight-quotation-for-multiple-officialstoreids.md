## Summary


Currently we have an issue with MELI integration regarding the Freight quotation API from MELI, this is applied only for sellers using multiple officialStoreIDs in MELI, but using only one account in VTEX using the same sellerID in MELI


##

## Simulation



If this scenario is applied the freight quotation from MELI will return error, and MELI will redirect the seller to freight spreadsheet instead of using the freight API.


##

## Workaround


keep the freight spreadsheet updated to avoid inconsistencies beteween VTEX and MELI
