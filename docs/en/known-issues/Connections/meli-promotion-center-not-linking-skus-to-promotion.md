## Summary



We currently have an issue while trying to link the VTEX SKU to corresponding MELI Promotion, this is not affecting all promotions and SKUs, but it happens in some rare cases due to MELi availability


##

## Simulation



While attaching the spreadsheet or trying to open the promotions module it may appear an error or it may not link to the correspondent MELI Promotion.


##

## Workaround



The seller can try again after sometime and it may solve the issue, until we find a permanent solution.
