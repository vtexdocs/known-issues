## Summary



We currently have an issue in MELI Mapper feature, which we decide to send a SKU as variation based on MELI's category attributes, and not based on what seller has mapped in VTEX, which means a product specification mapped in VTEX can be sent as variation to MELI.


##

## Simulation



Inside the mapper feature whenever the seller mapped an attribute that accepts variation in MELI it will be sent as variation, even if the seller mapped inside the product specification.

## Workaround
