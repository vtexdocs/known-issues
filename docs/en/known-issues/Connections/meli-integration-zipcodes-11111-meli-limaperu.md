## Summary



We currently have an issue with MELI orders that are coming from Lima/Peru, MELI is not sending the Zipcode of those orders, so we need to manually search for a default Zipcode


##

## Simulation



For MELI Lima/Peru orders, inside the OMS system will present the ZIPCode "11111" instead of the actual ZIPCode from the City.


##

## Workaround


n/a
