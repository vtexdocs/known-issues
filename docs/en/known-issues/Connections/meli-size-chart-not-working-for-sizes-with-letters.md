## Summary



Currently our MELI Size Chart feature is not working for sizes with letters example:

Size = "P", "M", "G".


##

## Simulation



Inside the mapper screen, we can the Size chart feature available for MELI Integration, So if the sellers maps a size with it's values as letters it won't work and a error message will be shown at bridge product like below:

"O valor do atributo SIZE Ã© invalido: P. Este valor deve ser igual ao da tabela de medidas."


##

## Workaround



The sizes are currently working with numbers, so sellers can use the numbers instead of letters.
