## Summary



In the new mapper screen, we do not have the option to create a custom attribute in MELI.


#### Simulation



Inside Mapper screen, the custom attribute is missing from what we had in the spreadsheet.


#### Workaround


currently no workaround is available, Its only allowed to create a custom valeu inside the attribute, but not a custom attribute.
