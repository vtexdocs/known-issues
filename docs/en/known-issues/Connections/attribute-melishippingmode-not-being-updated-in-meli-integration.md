## Summary



We currently have an issue with the product attribute named "meli_shipping_mode" which is not being updated in MELI integration


##

## Simulation



Inside the product specification the seller can use the attribute "meli_shipping_mode" and set ME1 or ME2 to define the shipping strategy in MELI.

But currently we can only sending this value while creating the SKU in MELI, and we are not updating with the correct value.



##

## Workaround
