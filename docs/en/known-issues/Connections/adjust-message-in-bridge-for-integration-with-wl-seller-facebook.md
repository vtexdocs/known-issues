## Summary


Adjust message in bridge for integration with WL seller



## Simulation


The price and stock that comes from the seller WL is being updated correctly in the facebook catalog, as we look at the main account and the main account doesn't really use price/stock, we ended up logging an error in the bridge: The SKU does not have a sales price in VTEX. This is a required value.

Action: Set msg on bridge to success



## Workaround


n/a
