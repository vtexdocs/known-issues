## Summary


Some orders were not created in OMS+Bridge and in the log it shows error: `"Object reference not set to an instance of an object"`

Marketplace: Magazine Luiza
Product Root Cause: Orders
Impact:  happens with few requests/exceptions


##

## Simulation


It could even be an error in the customer's request, where some mandatory field was missing and apparently the flow didn't predict that it would come "null" in some field.
