## Summary


Currently we have an issue that only affects the visibility of some MELI Orders, what happens is that we are currently logging the ShipmentID in order bridge menu, but some error messages are missing the OrderID, and it's necessary for some cases as the orderID is the information the sellers have in MELI Portal

Mercado Livre  > Bridge  > OrderId


##

## Simulation


Inside the bridge orders menu, some error messages are not logging the orderID, which gives the impressions some orders are not in VTEX brige, but the sellers can find the orders by searching for the shipmentID.

##

## Workaround


GET the OrderID, and get the ShipmentID and look for it in the bridge
