## Summary


Today Facebook looks at sellingPrice and listPrice to update the price in the Facebook catalog.


##

## Simulation


Seller is using unitMultiplier = 0.5

Checkout makes the following calculation when the item has a multiplier unit, so sellingPrice = price * unitMultiplier = 3999 * 0.5 = 1999.5. Checkout rounding will ignore the decimal and consider 1999

What is the problem with this calculation?
When the seller uses 0.5, for example, on Facebook we are updating it as the settlement price on Facebook.
2. When the seller uses a multiplier greater than 1.39, it falls within the promotional price even though it is higher than the listPrice



##

## Workaround


seller use unitMultiplier = 10000
