## Summary



Currently we have an issue with Buybox MELI flow, which is when removing the SKU from SC for example, the marketplace AD is being paused in MELi, but the Buybox AD remains active.


##

## Simulation



When the marketplace AD is paused in MELI, by the reason of being removed from VTEX SC for example, the Buybox AD would need to be paused as well.


##

## Workaround


Is there a workaround for this bug? If yes, describe it here. If not, write "N/A" or "There is no workaround available.". Do not remove this section if there is no workaround, please.
