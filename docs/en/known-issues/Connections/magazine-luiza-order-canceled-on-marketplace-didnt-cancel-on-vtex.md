## Summary


Order was canceled on the marketplace, but on OMS it was canceled and is still in the status "Waiting for authorization to dispatch"


##

## Simulation


- Order canceled on Makertplace;
- Order status was not updated to Canceled in OMS;
- Log does not show any errors in the flow;
- Bridge does not show any error;

We need to review the flow for canceled orders and the worker that fetches the status of these orders from the marketplace.


##

## Workaround


Is it possible to cancel the order using an internal route
