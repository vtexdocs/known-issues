## Summary



We currently have an issue with Amazon integration, when the SKU is removed from an existing Amazon Sales Channel, the disable notification is not being sent to Amazon seller center.


##

## Simulation



This may cause SKU's without Amazon Sales channel in VTEX, to be activated in Amazon seller center


##

## Workaround


When this case is identified seller can directly disable the SKU in Amazon seller center, to avoid order's from this SKU.
