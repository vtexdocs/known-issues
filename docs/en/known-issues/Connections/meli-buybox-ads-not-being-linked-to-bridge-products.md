## Summary



We currently have an issue related to Buybox Ads are not being linked to bridge products menu, if the Buybox association was made direclty in MELI.


##

## Simulation



When the seller is using MELI portal to directly link the Buybox ADs, those ADs are not reflecting in product bridge menu.


##

## Workaround



The Buybox Ads can still be seen directly in MELI, but not in VTEX bridge.
