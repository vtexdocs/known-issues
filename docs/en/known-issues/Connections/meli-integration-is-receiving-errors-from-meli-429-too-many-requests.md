## Summary



We currently have an issue with some accounts in MELi which are getting an error while trying to update products, stock or price in MELI.

This is not affecting all accounts and not all SKUs, but only part of them, and this is caused due to sending more requests then MELI is currently prepared to receive.


##

## Simulation



Inside integration stock/price/product menu some account may see an error:

**Sorry, we couldn't process this request. Please, wait a few minutes and reprocess it**

We are working on how to better handle the requests to avoid getting this error from MELI.


##

## Workaround


The only workaround available for now is to reprocess the request directly in bridge menu.
