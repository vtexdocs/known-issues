## Summary



We currently have a very specific scenario affecting few cases of SKUs not being able to update the stock on MELI.


##

## Simulation



What happens is that some cases the seller_custom_field which should be filled with the VTEX SKU, is actually blank, and so the integration is not able to update the MELI stock in this cases.


##

## Workaround


Fill the migration spreadsheet with this cases and send to product team to set our SKU inside seller_custom_field.
