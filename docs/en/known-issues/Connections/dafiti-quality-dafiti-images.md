## Summary


The image losing quality when it arrives at Dafiti.

**Marketplace:** Dafiti
**Product Root Cause:** Products > Images




## Simulation


Apparently, this happens because the image undergoes a 1000x1000 resizing before going to Dafiti and the marketplace already makes the adjustments so that it is within the established parameters, which in the case of Dafiti is:

m√°ximo 1104x1600
minimo 1000x1000



## Workaround


N/A
