## Summary



We per contact with Amazon, they changed the required attribute for some categories, and the number_of_itens, became a mandatory field for some categories, due to that we need to fix our integration to send this value to Amazon.



## Simulation



Inside bridge menu, in products section, you will see an error: A value is missing from one or more required columns from this group: [number_of_items = null]



## Workaround


Change global category until we fix this one.
