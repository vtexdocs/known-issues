## Summary


We are having some cases where the freight value is not showing inside the payments transactions details - OMS



## Simulation


Inside OMS in Payments tab we are showing the value of the SKU but missing the freight value

Important: This scenario only happens with FOB=True orders



## Workaround


Check inside the order details we have the full value of the transaction.
