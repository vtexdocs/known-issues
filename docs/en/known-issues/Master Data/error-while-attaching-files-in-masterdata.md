## Summary

The user receives the error message "Ocorreu um erro e o arquivo n√£o foi salvo" ("An error has happened and the file was not saved") when trying to manually attach a file through the CRM whose size exceeds 5MB.

## Simulation

1. Create a field of type `file`;
2. Enter the CRM;
3. Manually attach a file.

## Workaround

We recommend using another service for storing files larger than 5MB.

Note that MasterData V2 does not support the field with type attachment.
