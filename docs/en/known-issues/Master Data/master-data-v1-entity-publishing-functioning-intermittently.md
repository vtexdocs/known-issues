## Summary

A portion of VTEX accounts have reported being unable to publish any entity successfully.  This issue only affects V1 entities and has partially impacted newly created triggers.

## Simulation

- Visit your accountâ€™s Dynamic Storage https://{account}.ds.vtexcrm.com.br;
- Access the `Entidade de dados` tab and click on the `publish entity` button (icon is similar to a floppy disk);
- The system will report that the entity has been successfully published;
- Click `Ok` and visit `Logs Internos`;
- You will not see your recent entity publishing.


## Workaround

Unfortunately there is no workaround at the moment. The team is aware and working on a solution.
