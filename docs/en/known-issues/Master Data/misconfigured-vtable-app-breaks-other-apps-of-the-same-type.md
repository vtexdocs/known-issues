## Summary

A broken app (in red) prevents other apps from working properly.

Main causes of a badly configured app:
1. Non-existent JSON Schema (field "Model" in the app's JSON);
2. Apps with the same name;
3. Discrepancy between the entity's JSON Schema and the fields in the app's JSON.

## Simulation

In the case of a non-existent JSON Schema, insert the correct JSON Schema's name in the `model` field.

For example: ![Screen Shot 2019-01-03 at 19.31.53](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vtexdocs/help-center-content/refs/heads/main/docs/en/known-issues/Master%20Data/misconfigured-vtable-app-breaks-other-apps-of-the-same-type_1.png)

Notice how the app's border turns red and the error message on the console indicates "Error to get jsonschema by name": ![Screen Shot 2019-01-03 at 19.24.22](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vtexdocs/help-center-content/refs/heads/main/docs/en/known-issues/Master%20Data/misconfigured-vtable-app-breaks-other-apps-of-the-same-type_2.png)

## Workaround

The broken app will be in red. To solve it, just delete this app.
