## Summary

The user wants to export documents that are present in a separate entity. However, the cross entity exporting option was discontinued. 

In this example, we look at an user wanting to export emails from the address entity.


## Simulation



## Workaround

In order to achieve the same result, follow the following steps:

1. Export all relevant fields inside AD, including the userID.
2. Then, export the desired field from CL along with the userID.
3. With the two spreadsheets downloaded, merge the two datasets using the userID as key.
