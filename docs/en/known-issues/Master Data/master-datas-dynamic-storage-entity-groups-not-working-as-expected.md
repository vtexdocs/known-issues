## Summary

Grouping entities using the dropdown menu will generate an error message: `"Message":"Object reference not set to an instance of an object."}`.  

Note that this only applicable to V1 entities.

## Simulation

- Visit your account’s Dynamic Storage `https://{account}.ds.vtexcrm.com.br`;

- Access the `Entidade de dados` tab and click on the "__+__" button.

You will receive an error message saying `RESPONSE: {"Message":"Object reference not set to an instance of an object."}`.

## Workaround

Unfortunately there is no workaround at the moment. We are discontinuing this feature and no longer offering support.
