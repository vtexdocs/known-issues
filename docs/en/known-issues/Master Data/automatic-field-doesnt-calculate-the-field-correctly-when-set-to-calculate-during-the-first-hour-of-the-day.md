## Summary

The automatic field works correctly when set to recalculate itself when there is a new entry.  It stops working however, when set to one of the "first hour" options. ![inline1511102536](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vtexdocs/known-issues/refs/heads/main/docs/en/known-issues/Master%20Data/automatic-field-doesnt-calculate-the-field-correctly-when-set-to-calculate-during-the-first-hour-of-the-day_1.png)

## Simulation


1. Access https://{{account}}.ds.vtexcrm.com.br
2. Click on the "Automatic Field" tab
3. Choose the  data type
4. Select "First hour of the day" from the dropdown.

## Workaround

You can develop a middleware using VTEX.IO to emulate the automatic field's logic and have it set the field's value accordingly.
