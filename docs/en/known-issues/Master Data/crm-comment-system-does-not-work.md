## Summary

CRM comment system doesn't store the information that is entered.

The use of the comment system, be it directly or through triggers, is compromised.

## Simulation

1. Access https://{{account}}.vtexcrm.com.br;
2. Choose a document;
3. Type in the comment field and click on `Save`. The system will respond with "Your review has been saved successfully";
4. The comment disappears.

## Workaround

A possible workaround would be to create a field of type `Text` and make it visible on the form.

You can then create or edit the value of the field.
