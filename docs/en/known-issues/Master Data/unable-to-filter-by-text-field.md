## Summary

Even though a text field can be set to be __Public to Filter__, the user will always receive the following error message: `Cannot filter by private fields`.


## Simulation

- Visit your account’s Dynamic Storage `https://{account}.ds.vtexcrm.com.br`;

- Access the `Entidade de dados` tab, choose an entity, and set a text field to be public to filter.

When querying for that field through the API you will always receive an error message.

## Workaround

You can set the field to be a Varchar 750. This will allow you to filter normally.
