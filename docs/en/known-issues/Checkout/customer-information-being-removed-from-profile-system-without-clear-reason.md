## Summary


Sometimes we receive reports where the customer information was removed from Master Data's CL and AD entities, which can be managed in a lot of ways â€“ direct usage from Master Data by the store itself (UI, API, importing/exporting data) and other internal integrations from the platform, like the CHK service trough Profile System.

While the changes are made with the same internal application key, there's no clarity about the origin service that calls the MD/PS. But, considering the context, previous modifications, their timestamp along the created order, we can easily associate a lot of these cases to the Checkout.

We can easily relate occurrences like this to the KI's #340036 and #327630.



## Simulation


There's no direct way to reproduce orders in this scenario. We are restricted to previously reported orders.



## Workaround


N/A
