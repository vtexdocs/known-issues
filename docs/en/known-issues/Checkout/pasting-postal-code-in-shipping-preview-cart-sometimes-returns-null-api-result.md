## Summary


After entering the postal code once in the shipping preview and choosing to paste it again, it sometimes occurs to make a null request to the zip code API.

The request is `/api/checkout/pub/postal-code/null/postalcodenumber` and returns a 500 error.


##

## Simulation



- Go to the cart and add a postal code;
- Click to change it and paste another postal code (or even the same);
- Go to the shipping step, and the address may be incomplete.


##

## Workaround


The user will need to click the "Calculate" button or hit the enter key, in some cases typing the postal code without inserting it.
