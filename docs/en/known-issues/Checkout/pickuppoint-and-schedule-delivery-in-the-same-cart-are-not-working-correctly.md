## Summary


The UI does not work correctly in a cart with more than one item with a delivery split in which one of the items is available for pick up and the others only for scheduled delivery.

The date for choosing pick-up items is set without problems. But the dates for the scheduled delivery do not behave as expected.


##

## Simulation



- Assemble a cart with at least two items where one of the items is available for pick up and the others only for scheduled delivery;
- In the shipping step, select Pick up in store and select a delivery window ;
- Try to select a delivery window for the schedule delivery.
