## Summary


The configuration of the maximum quantity of the same item in the cart cannot be changed by franchise accounts (seller whitelabel), as it takes place in a legacy catalog screen (/admin/Site/ConfigForm.aspx) â€“ module that is removed from franchise accounts, as they inherit the products of the parent account.


##

## Simulation



- Enter a franchise or whitelabel seller account environment
- Access the screen "CMS > Settings > General tab" from the admin, or go directly to the page /admin/Site/ConfigForm.aspx
- Note that it is not possible to access the content of this area


##

## Workaround


Request the configuration via ticket to VTEX.
