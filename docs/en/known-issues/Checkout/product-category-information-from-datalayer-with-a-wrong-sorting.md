## Summary


The product category information in the dataLayer at checkout pages is shown in the wrong sorting. This is represented by the "categoryTree" property.

They'll follow their IDs, sorted from low to high, which may not represent the expected hierarchy for this information.


##

## Simulation


Add a product to the cart and compare the properties "productCategoryIds" and "productCategories" from the orderForm with the property "categoryTree" from the dataLayer.


##

## Workaround


The same information can be retrieved from the orderForm API instead of the dataLayer.
