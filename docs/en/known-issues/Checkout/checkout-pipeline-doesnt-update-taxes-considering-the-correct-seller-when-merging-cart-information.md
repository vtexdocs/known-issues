## Summary


When there are 2 sellers in the "SellerElection" method, one of them is selected as having the cheapest price for delivery, and the other one the cheapest price for pickup-in-point, the cart information merge doesn't update taxes when selecting pickup-in-point, causing an error to finish the purchase


##

## Simulation



- Have two sellers configured: 1 is the cheapest when delivery and the other one when pickup-in-point
- Configure taxes _only_ for the seller that will fulfill pickup-in-point or different taxes between them
- Perform a Checkout Simulation and you will see there will be no taxes in "priceTags" and it won't finish the purchase
