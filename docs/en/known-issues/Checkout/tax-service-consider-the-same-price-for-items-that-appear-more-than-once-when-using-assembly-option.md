## Summary


When using Assembly Options, if the item is added again to the cart, it will appear twice and the Tax Service will consider only the price for that item that is first in the cart, causing tax divergence values when placing an order.


##

## Simulation



- Configure Tax Hub in an account;
- Configure Assembly Options;
- Add an item that was included in the Assembly Option to the cart;
