## Summary


When the order has "profileErrorOnLoading=true", the expected behavior is that the customer profile, address, and credit card won't be saved/updated on the Profile System.

The problem is that the checkout is still making some requests to register the buyer's e-mail, naturally, without sending other fields like name and phone. So, if the customer is already registered in the store, these fields are cleared, and the customer data is lost.


##

## Simulation


We can't simulate the behavior since the "profileErrorOnLoading" is just for unexpected exceptions.


##

## Workaround


N/A
