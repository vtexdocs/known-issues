## Summary



The checkout, when assembling the payload for the tax service, uses the document data (whether corporate or not) in place of the email. In this way, the `clientEmail` variable retains the definition of the document that was received and not the email itself.



## Simulation


Make a simulation for the FFM by correctly passing the customer data in the `clientProfileData` and notice using the debug mode the request that is made to the tax service the `clientEmail` variable using the information that was passed in the `corporateDocument` or `document` (depending on the type of document)



## Workaround


Don't take into account the `clientEmail`, but the email that is inside the `clientData`. There the data is correct.
