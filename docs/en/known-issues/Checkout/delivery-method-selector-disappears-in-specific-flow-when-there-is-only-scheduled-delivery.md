## Summary


The date/time selector for scheduled delivery disappears when the user switches from "pick up" to "receive", this behavior occurs regardless of the use of the Lean Shipping feature.

Apparently the common factor is that the only "receive" options are scheduled, and the "withdraw" options are not scheduled, so this problem may not happen in other scenarios.



## Simulation


1- Have an item whose delivery can be made on a scheduled basis and also has the option of pick in store.
2- Insert this item in the cart
3- Advance to the delivery step
4- Insert a zip code that has delivery availability.
5- In the shipping area, choose the option to "remove" in the toogle
6- Now choose the "delivery" option in the toogle;
7- At this point the UI will no longer display the "choose delivery date and time" button.
