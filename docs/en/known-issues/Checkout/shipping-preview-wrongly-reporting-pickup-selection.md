## Summary


In the cart, when informing your location, the shipping preview erroneously informs which pickup was selected for this pick-up. When in fact, two pickup options should be displayed (there was a package break in this example). And when arriving at the checkout, the information is provided correctly, with the withdrawals in the respective correct pickups.



## Simulation


When there is a package break to pick up items in two different pickups, when arriving at the cart and entering the postal code, the shipping preview informs only one of these pickups as selected. The correct would be the two pickups.
