## Summary


In the checkout flow `deliverySlaInMinutes` delivery checkout along with the transaction details to the gateway, this data is calculated based on the `shippingEstimate` delivered by logistics, however when this value delivered by logistics is = 0 the checkout response for `deliverySlaInMinutes` is 0 null, when the correct one would be 0; however this ends up directly affecting the flow developed by the gateway for anti-fraud;



## Simulation


1- Create an order with Pick up
2- The `shippingEstimate` must be 0
3- Check the transaction data and see that the `deliverySlaInMinutes` is = null;




## Workaround


There is no direct workaround, however, if it is possible to avoid that the `shippingEstimate` delivered by logistic calculation, being equal to 0, it is possible to mitigate the scenario;
