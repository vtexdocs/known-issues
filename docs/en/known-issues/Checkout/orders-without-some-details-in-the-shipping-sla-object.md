## Summary


Some orders from native sellers (including the "seller 1") have been reported as not returning some details on the shipping SLA object, like the `"transitTime"` or even `"deliveryIds"`. But the information is available at the fulfillment order (on the seller side).



## Simulation


This scenario can't be reproduced, since it happens intermittently.



## Workaround


N/A
