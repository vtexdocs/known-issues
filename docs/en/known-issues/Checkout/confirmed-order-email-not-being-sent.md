## Summary


Checkout doesn't map all the flows where the "GatewayCallback" must trigger the "Raised OrderPlaced" event, so unmapped flows are suitable not to fire this event as expected, directly affecting the order confirmation email to be sent.


##

## Simulation


There is no way to simulate the scenario.


##

## Workaround


N/A
