## Summary


Google Maps address searches for countries without specific internal rules aren't filtered to return only this selected country.


##

## Simulation


Considering Panama as a country that fits this internal condition, while in the geolocation mode and searching for "calle", the component brings addresses from Spain instead of strictly filtering to Panama addresses.


##

## Workaround


N/A
