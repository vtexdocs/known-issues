## Summary



When using the **Omnishipping** component on checkout, the **PickupReceiver** field will show blank when it should have the name the client input in the Identification step. This only happens if the client first informs an address for delivery and then clicks on the Pickup tab to select a pick-up point.


##

## Simulation



1. Install the Omnishipping component in a store without any customizations on checkout
2. Start a checkout process and fill the identification information
3. Select an address for delivery but then click in the Pickup Option
4. The PickupReceiver field will show blank
