## Summary


When the logged-in user arrives at the shipping stage, with the address already pre-selected and with the SLA available for that location, when editing their address with the exact same information filled in before, the UI informs that there is no delivery available. Even the API response being that there is yes SLA available (since it is the same address).



## Simulation


Having a user with a registered address, and this address has delivery available, when going to the shipping stage, edit the address with the same information. Right after editing the message is that there is no more SLA available.




## Workaround
