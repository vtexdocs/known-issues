## Summary


When you select a pickup option that it's not highlighted, the UI makes an incorrect request to the API, and with that, the request receives an error and does not refresh the data from this selected pickup.

Note: this happens only in the cart; in the checkout, the requests are ok.



## Simulation


Use a store that has a lot of pickup options (you need to select one that it's not highlighted); in the cart, choose this one and see that the request it's going to be `api/checkout/pub/orderForms/simulation?sc=undefined&rnbBehavior=0` receiving an error message with `Message: "An error has occurred."`
