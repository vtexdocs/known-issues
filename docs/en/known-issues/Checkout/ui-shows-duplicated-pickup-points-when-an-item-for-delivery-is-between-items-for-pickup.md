## Summary


In a cart with at least three products, where the item orders are: 1st is for pick-up, 2nd is for delivery, and 3rd is for pick-up, the UI will show the pick-up point duplicated. This happens because the API will group the 1st item and 3rd item since it's the same SLA.

It's possible to go to the payment step and finish the purchase.


##

## Simulation



- Add an item to the cart for pick-up;
- Add an item to the cart for delivery;
- Add another item to the cart for pick-up;
- In the shipping step, the pick-up will be duplicated
