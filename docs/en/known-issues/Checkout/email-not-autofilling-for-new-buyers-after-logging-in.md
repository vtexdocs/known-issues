## Summary


When a new buyer logs in and proceeds to checkout, the email isn't automatically filled in requiring the customer to re-enter their email. This also happens using APIs and sending in headers with the buyer's cookies.


##

## Simulation



- Log in with an email never used before in the store;
- Add products to the cart;
- Go to checkout;
- The email won't be filled, and it should be typed again.
