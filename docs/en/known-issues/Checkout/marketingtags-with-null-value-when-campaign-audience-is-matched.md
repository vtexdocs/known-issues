## Summary


When an account has a campaign audience and a logged-in user is matched, checkout uses the information registered in the session, which only has the campaign's id. In `marketingTags`, it should have the campaign's name, but it's `null` as there is no information available in the session.


##

## Simulation



- Create a campaign audience;
- Log in with a user that the campaign is matched;
- Check the field `marketingData.marketingTags` in the orderForm, it will have a null value and the campaign's name.
