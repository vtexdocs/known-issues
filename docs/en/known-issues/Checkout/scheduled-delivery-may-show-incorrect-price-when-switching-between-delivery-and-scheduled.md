## Summary


When it's configured a shipping maximum value promotion, if you start changing between standard delivery and scheduled delivery several times, there may be a different scheduled delivery price in the UI


##

## Simulation



- Create a shipping maximum value promotion;
- Assemble a cart that has standard and scheduled delivery;
- Select the standard delivery;
- Select the scheduled delivery;
- Keep alternating it, and at some point, the scheduled delivery price may be different from the API
