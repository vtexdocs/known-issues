## Summary


After changing (update or deleting) some item attachments in the products catalog, if you already have some cart/orderForm that refers to items with the specific attachment, the orderForm can't be loaded anymore.

The cart/checkout page will present a "communication error with the seller" – because the item attachments come from the fulfillment service inside the checkout's pipeline. In Splunk, the error logs (that can be filtered by their operationId) will detail the exception message "_Some item attachments are not available_".



## Simulation


- to have an item with attachment fields
- insert this item in a cart and fill the attachment fields
- change/remove some of these fields in the products catalog
- go back to the cart (expect some cache in the catalog information to see the changes)
- the cart won't load and generate the mentioned error



## Workaround


N/A
