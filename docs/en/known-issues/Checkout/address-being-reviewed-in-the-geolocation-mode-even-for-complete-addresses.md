## Summary


The "calculate shipping" button, used for address validation in the geolocation mode (address inserted via Google Maps), is being shown even for complete addresses. It should be shown only for edited addresses – due to changed information or addresses that were incomplete at the first moment – to ensure that they are valid, but not for complete addresses.



## Simulation


In a store that is using the geolocation mode, insert an address. Be sure to be a complete address that will return the street, neighborhood, and especially the number. The "calculate shipping" button shouldn't be shown.

It may not happen for every country.



## Workaround
