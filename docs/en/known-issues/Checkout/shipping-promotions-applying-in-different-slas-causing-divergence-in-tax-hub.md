## Summary


When shipping promotions apply for different SLAs, one of them is free shipping, it causes divergence in the request sent by the Tax Hub, preventing the order from being placed.


##

## Simulation



- Create a free shipping promotion for a specific SLA;
- Create any other shipping promotion for another SLA;
- Try placing an order, the message "The requested order could not be created. Please try again".


##

## Workaround
