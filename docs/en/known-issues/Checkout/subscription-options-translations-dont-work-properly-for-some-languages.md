## Summary


In the cart, the subscription periods are wrong in UI. But, if you look at the orderForm, the period is showing correctly.

This happens for Arabic, Czech, Indonesian, Korean, Polski, Romanian, Slovak, and Slovene.


##

## Simulation



- Access the cart with a product that has a subscription configured with more than one period;
- Add the subscription, and look at the options;
- The options will be translated to 1 day/month always.
