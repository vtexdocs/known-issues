## Summary


It isn't possible to finish purchases where the marketplace is applying promotions to items from sellers that are under multilevel behavior. The customer will see a generic error message.

These sellers are defined by having their "fulfillmentEndpoint" as "/api/checkout". They make use of this flow to forward the order to a 3rd-layer, which is another seller (whitelabel).

It affects the cart/orderForm purchase flow and also the order creation via the placeOrder API.



## Simulation


To simulate this scenario, you need to:
- create a cart using some SKU that has a promotion applied to it.
- make sure that the marketplace is under some recursive account.

This order will fail as reported.



## Workaround


N/A
