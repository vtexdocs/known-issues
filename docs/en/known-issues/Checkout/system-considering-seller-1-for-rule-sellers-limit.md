## Summary


Today, in a scenario where we have an account that uses an architecture in the MOI (marketplace/multilevel seller) model, the system considers seller 1 as part of the calculation to limit the number of sellers in the cart that can be configured using the maxNumberOfWhiteLabelSellers key



## Simulation


To replicate the scenario it is necessary to have configured the account with the MOI flow;

In the level seller, the limitation on the number of sellers in the cart must be configured;

They must have in the cart items whose deliveries are made by the first seller and by the whitelabel seller linked to this same seller;

When filling in the data and trying to close the order, an error will be displayed linked to the limitation of the number of sellers in the cart



## Workaround


N/A
