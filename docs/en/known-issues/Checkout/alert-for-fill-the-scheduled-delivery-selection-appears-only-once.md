## Summary



When the user arrives at the date selection stage for the scheduled delivery, if he does not select any date and proceeds to the payment stage, the alert and the opening of the pop to select appears as expected. However, this behavior only happens once, if he fills in the address data and still continues with the date without choice, the pop no longer opens for the selection and with that the user cannot proceed to the payment step without knowing that it is necessary to select a date, thus generating a bad usability experience and perhaps even an impediment to closing the purchase.



## Simulation



When you get to the date selection step, do not make the selection and try to proceed to the payment step, fill in all the necessary data except the date you want.
