## Summary


Our API to list pickup points by location is always returning `nullÂ ` in the `additionalInfo` field. However, as this data normally comes from the logistics API then this data is present in the orderForm when placing an order at checkout.



## Simulation


Firstly, create a pickup point in the store admin and fill in the additional information field (pickup instructions and tags). After that, perform a call to our API which lists the pickup points by location and there you can see this field with `null`.



## Workaround


No workaround available.
