## Summary


In a cart with items for pickup and delivery, checkout's simulation only considers the information on the shippingData.address object for the tax service request. For example, considering those addresses are from different states, and the tax provider considers different taxes for each state, one of the items will have the wrong tax applied.


##

## Simulation



- Configure Tax Service;
- Add two items to a cart with different selected addresses: one for pickup and the other for delivery.


##

## Workaround


N/A
