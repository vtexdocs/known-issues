## Summary


When using an item in a cart with a gift promotion benefit, the item within cannot be removed if it is unavailable after pickup-point selection.


##

## Simulation



- create a cart with a regular item and a gift (to be offered through a promotion)
- choose to pickup in point, but through an option that doesn't have the gift item available
- it'll present the message to choose a different pickup option or remove the item from the cart, which is a button/link as a call to action
- clicking on the option to remove the item won't work due to the issue when the item is a gift
