## Summary



When the user arrives at the checkout and the delivery is scheduled and there is more than one item where the delivery division takes place, therefore, items leaving an X and Y SLA.
When selecting the first delivery date and when refreshing the page, the UI ends selecting the same date and time for also the second selection, even if the user has not interacted with the selection modal.



## Simulation



Having scheduled delivery and also breaking packages between different SLAs, choosing only the date and time selection for the first package, refreshing the page and realizing that the selection was also made for the second package.




## Workaround
