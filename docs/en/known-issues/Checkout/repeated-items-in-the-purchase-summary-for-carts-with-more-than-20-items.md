## Summary


When arriving at the checkout with more than 20 items, the items shown in the purchase summary (top-right items list) may be duplicated. The totalizers and even the API are correct. The scenario doesn't happen on the main list of items (cart step).



## Simulation



- Create a cart with more than 20 items;
- Advance into some checkout setup (profile, shipping, or payment)
- Go back and forth between the checkout and cart pages using the UI buttons;
- The items will be duplicated.



## Workaround


N/A
