## Summary

The United Arab Emirates doesn't have postal codes, and the Checkout UI only accepts two inputs: postal code or geocoordinates.

If the store configures postal code input, when arriving at the shipping step at checkout, the United Arab Emirates country does not work correctly – and potentially others.

It is not possible to add anything to the component.

## Simulation

- Go to the shipping step;
- No field to add the postal code is shown;

## Workaround

Add any dummy postal code via API, the fields will be shown then, for example, via console:

    vtexjs.checkout.sendAttachment('shippingData', { "selectedAddresses": [{ addressType: "residential", country: "ARE", postalCode: "0" }]}).done(r=>{ console.log(r)})

Result:

## **Workaround**
For geocoordinates, it's possible to move with the purchase:
