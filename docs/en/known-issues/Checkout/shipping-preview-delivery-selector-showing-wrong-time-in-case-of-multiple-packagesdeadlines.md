## Summary


If the cart has multiple packages with different delivery times, the Shipping Preview delivery selector displays only one of the terms, giving incorrect information.
The expected behavior in this scenario is that the selector displays the message **Varied deadlines** and below the selector there is a message referring to the delivery period of each package in business days.


##

## Simulation
