## Summary


In cases where a seller acts as a white-label seller and as a regular seller for different items in the same cart, the payment amount will be with the shipping value doubled.


##

## Simulation



- Add an item fulfilled by a seller's white label in the cart;
- Add another item from the same seller but as a regular seller;
- Place the order; you will see different values in the order and transaction.


##

## Workaround


Refrain from mixing the types of sellers for the same seller.
