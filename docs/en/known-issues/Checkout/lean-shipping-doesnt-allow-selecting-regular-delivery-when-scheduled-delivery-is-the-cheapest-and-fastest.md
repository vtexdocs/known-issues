## Summary


In carts where there is a scheduled delivery and a regular delivery, and Lean Shipping is activated; if the cheapest and fastest option is the scheduled delivery, the UI will show the toggle normally, but when deselecting, nothing will happen, and the scheduled delivery will still be selected.


##

## Simulation



- Register scheduled delivery and a regular delivery;
- Make sure the scheduled delivery is the cheapest and fastest between both;
- Activate lean shipping;
- In the shipping step, select scheduled delivery and deselect; nothing will change.


##

## Workaround


Deactivate the lean shipping.
