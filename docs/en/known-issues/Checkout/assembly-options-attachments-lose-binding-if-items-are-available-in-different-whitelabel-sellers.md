## Summary


Assembly options attachments lose binding when two items are added to the cart from different white-label sellers (one of the sellers can be seller 1), and both have the same attachments registered in the assembly options.

The expected behavior is that each attachment is delivered according to its assembly options. However, both attachments will be delivered by the same seller, causing all the assembly options attachments and the second item to show as unavailable.
