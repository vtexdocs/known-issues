## Summary


We received some inquiries about orders that were stuck in payment approved status but already payment approved, which the normal order flow should not happen.

Based on the analysis of the cases, we understand that a possible occurrence of this occurrence was;

The marketplace order was created incomplete, the marketplace order receives the gatewaycallback call and, at this time, a failure occurs, and this causes an order cancellation process to start, but the marketppace order receives a second call from gatewaycallback that causes the order to be authorized and complete, thus preventing the transaction from being canceled, and this scenario generates a complete order (marketplace / checkout), but with a creation error and the fullfiment order canceled, which could be avoided implementing a validation in gatewaycallback to not proceed with incomplete requests.
In some cases, the Seller order may not be cancelled.


##

## Simulation



We cannot simulate due to the complexity of the flow, the analysis must be done considering the data reported here.



##

## Workaround


In cases where the Seller's order is not canceled, you must cancel the order manually, or wait for the 30-day time limit.
