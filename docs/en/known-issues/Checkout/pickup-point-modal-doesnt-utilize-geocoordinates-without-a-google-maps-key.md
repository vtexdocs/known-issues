## Summary


Inserting a postal code into the pickup point selector modal triggers a request to obtain available SLAs for that location. If the account doesn't have a Google Maps API key defined in its Checkout settings, this request will not include geoCoordinates information. This may result in pickup points within a valid range not being shown, such as ones whose freight tables are based on polygons.


##

## Simulation



1. Use a store that doesn't have a Google Maps API key defined.
2. Set up a pickup point, and bind it to a carrier whose freight table is based on polygons.
3. Add a product to your cart.
4. In the shipping preview, select the pickup option, and input a postal code that has availability for the pickup point you've created.
5. Inspect the shippingData request generated by this action. It will not contain geoCoordinates.



##

## Workaround


Set a Google Maps API key on the store's Checkout settings.
