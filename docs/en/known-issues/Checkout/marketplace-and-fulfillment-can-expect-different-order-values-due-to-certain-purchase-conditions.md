## Summary


Marketplace and Fulfillment layers may expect different values for the order, preventing purchase completion.
In such cases, the Marketplace's `sellingPrice` for the item does not match its Fulfillment `price`.


##

## Simulation


The issue is not necessarily restricted to this exact step-by-step, but is easiest to reproduce as follows:

1. Set the Marketplace and seller's decimal places to zero.
2. At the seller's account, set an item's price to 49950.00, and a Fulfillment promotion that applies a 15% discount to it.
3. At a Marketplace, add 3 units of the seller's item to your cart.
4. Try to complete the purchase. The error message "The requested order could not be created. Please try again." will be displayed.
