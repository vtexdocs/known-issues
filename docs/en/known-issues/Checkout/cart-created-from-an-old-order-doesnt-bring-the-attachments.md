## Summary


When creating a cart from an old order ("Order again" button on "My orders" screen), the attachments and services from the original order will not be retained.


##

## Simulation



1. Order a product with attachments and/or services;
2. Access the "My orders" screen;
3. Click on "Order again";
4. Note that the cart that was then generated only brought the SKUs from the previous order.


##

## Workaround


Currently, there is no workaround for this scenario.
