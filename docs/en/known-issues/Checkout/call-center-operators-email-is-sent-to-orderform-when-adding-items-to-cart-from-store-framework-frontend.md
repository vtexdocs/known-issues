## Summary


When using Store Framework components to add items to a cart while logged in as a call center operator and not impersonating any customer, the operator's email is filled in the orderForm's clientProfileData attachment.


##

## Simulation



1. Access a store built on Store Framework.
2. Authenticate as a call center operator.
3. Without impersonating any customers, add an item to the cart with a component such as add-to-cart-button.
4. Verify that the cart now contains the call center operator's email address.
