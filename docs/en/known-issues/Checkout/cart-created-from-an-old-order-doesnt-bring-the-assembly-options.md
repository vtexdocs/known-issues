## Summary


When creating a cart from an old order ("Order again" button on "My orders" screen), the assembly options from the original order will not be retained.


##

## Simulation



1. Order a product with assembly options;
2. Access the "My orders" screen;
3. Click on "Order again";
4. Note that the cart that was then generated only brought the SKUs from the previous order, without their assemblies.


##

## Workaround


Currently, there is no workaround for this scenario.
