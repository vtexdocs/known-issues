## Summary


Whenever a cart has a total value of `0` no transaction is created upon finishing an order.  When completing an order through checkout's UI no process order request happens, so the cart items and data are kept, and the shopper can create an order with the same cart again.


##

## Simulation



- Create a cart with total value `0`;
- Finish the purchase;
- Reaccess the cart after some time; there will be no change in the cart content.


##

## Workaround


There is no workaround available.
