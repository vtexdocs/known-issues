## Summary


Checkout UI unselects the "Schedule all" toggle in the shipping step after refreshing the page, even though the API is still selected. This behavior has no impact; the order will have the scheduled delivery selected.


##

## Simulation



- Add an item that has scheduled and regular delivery;
- Select the scheduled delivery, fill out all the information, and go to Payments;
- Go back to Shipping and refresh the page;
- The "Schedule all" will be unselected.

## Workaround
