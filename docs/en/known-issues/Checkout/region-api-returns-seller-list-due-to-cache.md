## Summary


When using a subaccount structure with region, if the API Get sellers by region or address is used in both accounts for the same sales channel, and one of them is not available for that sales channel, it will return a seller list due to cache.


##

## Simulation



- Create a new store;
- Set different sales channel for the store;
- Use the API Get sellers by region or address in the store;
- Use again the API for the same sales channel in the other store.
