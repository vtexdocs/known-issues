## Summary


In some cases, Checkout API uses "::" as a separator when there are several cities possibilities from the zip code service, causing an error about excessive size in the field address, impacting placing the order. This behavior happens because the API has a autocomplete for address


##

## Simulation


Considering Argentina as an example that fits this condition, when adding the postal code 4427 via "vtexjs" or API you can see the address defined in the orderForm separated by "::"


##

## Workaround


Via API: send the parameter `"clearAddressIfPostalCodeNotFound": false` in the request to avoid the address being autocompleted
Via "vtexjs": use the function "sendAttachment()" instead of "calculateShipping()" so it's possible to use the parameter mentioned above
