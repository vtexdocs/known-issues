## Summary


In the shipping preview, when selecting pick up in store, but not all items are available for that pick-up, the address displayed for shipping is from the chosen pick-up, and it's not possible to change it. In the orderForm, the selected address for shipping is correct though.


##

## Simulation



- Add items to the cart where at least one is not available for pickup;
- Add a postal code to the cart;
- Change to pick up in store;
- The postal code shown for shipping is from the chosen pick-up.


##

## Workaround


Change the postal code in the shipping step.
