## Summary


When there is more than one address registered in the Profile System, there is a "null" request to the zip code service if you add a new address on "Invoice Address".


##

## Simulation



- Have more than 1 address registered in the Profile System;
- Select a pickup point;
- Click on "Deliver to another address" to add a new address on "Invoice Address" without selecting any other option.

The request was `/api/checkout/pub/postal-code/null/postalcodenumber`, so it returns the 500 error. Due to this return, it doesn't autocomplete the address using the zip code service.


##

## Workaround


Select an option already registered before adding a new address
