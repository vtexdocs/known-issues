## Summary


The Order replacement feature doesn't work when the replaced cart has the same value as the original order, and the payment system is "Reuse Payment".


##

## Simulation



- Activate the Order replacement feature;
- Complete an order and change something, for example, from size small to large;
- Make sure the replaced cart has the same value as the original order;
- In the payment step, select "Reuse Payment".


##

## Workaround


Select a payment method different from "Reuse Payment". The previous transaction will be canceled and refunded; a new one will be created.
