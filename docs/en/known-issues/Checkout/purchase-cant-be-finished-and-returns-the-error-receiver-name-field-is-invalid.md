## Summary


There's a high volume of errors in the process of creating an order with the message "_The receiver name field in the shipping attachment is invalid_". Seems to be something related to our checkout UI. We don't have resources to understand how much it's really affecting or blocking sales.



## Simulation


There's no known way to simulate this behavior.



## Workaround


There's no known workaround for that, except applying custom validations to the affected field.
