## Summary


Checkout UI converts the time using the computer's time zone displaying the delivery date incorrectly in shipping-preview (cart) when items are scheduled delivery.


##

## Simulation



- Configure a scheduled delivery window to start at 0h
- Set up a time zone that subtracts from UTC+00:00 in the computer
- You will see that the date shown is the day before


##

## Workaround


Configure scheduled delivery windows during the daytime, such as business hours since it's the most common time for deliveries
