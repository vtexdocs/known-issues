## Summary


Searching a pickup point in the cart or checkout while in a narrow/portrait responsive layout (width less than 1024px) using the map view, results will be presented in the list mode instead of the own map, and this list won't work (the user can't scroll it down).



## Simulation



- open pickup point options
- toggle to map mode
- search for an address that can provide multiple results
- note that the options will be presented on the list mode, but the toggle still under the map mode, and you can't scroll down the list



## Workaround


N/A
