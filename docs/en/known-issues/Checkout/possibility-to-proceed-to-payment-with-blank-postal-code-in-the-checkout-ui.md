## Summary


When you are a user who has a login and goes to checkout, where the data is masked, and in the shipping form, choose the option of delivering to other addresses, there is the possibility of going to the payment without the need to fill in the postal code. Thus, arriving at the payment process with empty delivery data on the UI.

1. Add products to cart (without login)
2. Go to the checkout and fill with your email (user that have data completed, address and profile)
3. Get into checkout with your data masked
4. Go to the Shipping form and choose "Deliverer in another address"
5. Don't fill the postal code and press the button "Go to payment"
