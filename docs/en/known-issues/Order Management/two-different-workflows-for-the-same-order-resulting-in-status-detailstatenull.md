## Summary


Due to a failure in the workflow creation step, some orders whose creation flow was completed correctly, may present the following value in the status field: `detail.state.null `and in the order listing they do not display any status value;

This error occurs due to the duplicate creation of the Workflow during the order creation process, Workflow is the object that manages the status change and once duplicated it ends up generating this inconsistency;



## Simulation


There is no way to simulate the error.




## Workaround


For this case, the applicable workaround is to request the analysis of the affected orders and also the adjustment of the status, through a ticket;
