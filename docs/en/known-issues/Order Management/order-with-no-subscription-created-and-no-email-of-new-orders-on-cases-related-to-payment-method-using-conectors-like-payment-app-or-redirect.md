## Summary


For orders with payment method using conectors like payment app or redirect there is no GatewayCallback to Checkout who is responsible to create the subscription and send a new-order email.
And because of that Checkout are not sending the event Finished Order Group, thats indicates the order as completed.


So for orders using this kind of payments connectors method, there are two scenarios or one inclunding both.

1 - Commun Order - No email from new-order template will be sent.
2 - Order responsible to generate the subscription  - Will not create the subscription and dont send the first new-order email.
