## Summary


Specifically for the special character ":", when we have a seller with this special character in the name, and we try to filter it for reporting, we have the following when we view it in "devtools":

"Cannot return null for non-nullable field ReportDetails.rowNumber."


##

## Simulation


To simulate this behavior, it is necessary to select a seller that contains this special character in the name and try to remove a report from it.


##

## Workaround


For Workaround, this special character must be removed from the seller's name.
