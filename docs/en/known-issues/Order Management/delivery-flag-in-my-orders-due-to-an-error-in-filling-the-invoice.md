## Summary



If the order invoice does not have the correct information on the quantity of items and the order SKU Ids. It will not be possible to insert the "`Delivered`" flag in 'My Orders'.




## Simulation



To simulate this behavior, it is possible to place an order with only one Item.

When invoicing the order, insert the ID of another item on the invoice and/or insert the quantity of more Items.

After invoicing the order, do the "update tracking" and enter the information of "`isDelivered: true`".

We will have the order information "delivered" in the UI, however, in "My Orders" it will continue with the information of "Sending Order".




## Workaround



Be careful not to insert more items on the invoice and/or items with different order IDs. Because in these cases the order will not have the "delivered" flag in My Orders.
