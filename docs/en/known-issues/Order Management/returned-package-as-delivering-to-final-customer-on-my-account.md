## Summary


There is a scenario where the returned package shows as delivering on **My Account > My Orders** page. It looks like more than one package is going to be delivered to the customer instead of showing that the package was already delivered to the customer and that a new package was generated symbolizing the return.

It can create some confusion for the final client because it looks like receiving more products and doesnâ€™t show as fully delivered in the **My Orders** flow.



## Simulation



- Make an order with one product/package.
- Complete the order flow and mark as delivered.
- Try to return that item.
- It will generate a new package that represents the product return.
- So on My Orders page shows that returned package as a one more.
- The customer and the store admin user can be confused with the order status and flow detail.


## Workaround


There is no workaround available.
