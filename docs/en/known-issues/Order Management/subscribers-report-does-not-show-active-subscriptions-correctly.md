## Summary


When we export the subscribers report, the information in the `TotalSubscriptions` and `TotalSubscriptionsActives` columns are divergent compared to the information shown in the dashboard.
This is due to some subscriptions that were migrated from v2 to v3, because in v2 the architecture was different, being considered by SKU, and in v3 is considered by order.



## Simulation


You can simulate this scenario with a subscription that has been migrated from v2 to v3.

1. Go to the functionality "**Orders > Subscriptions > Dashboards > Subscribers > Export Report**";
2. Check an email that has at least one subscription with more than one SKU;
3. Note that the number of subscriptions in the report will be the same as the number of SKUs, not the subscriptions.



## Workaround


There is no workaround available.
