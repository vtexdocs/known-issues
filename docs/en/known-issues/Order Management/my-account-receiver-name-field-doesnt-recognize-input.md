## Summary


When trying to register the first address in this account, through "My Account > direcciones", the information is displayed that it is "mandatory" to enter "Datos del Tercero Autorizado", but even after entering this information and clicking on "Anadir Direccion" the address is not registered and the message that it is "mandatory" is displayed again, only after the second attempt is the address saved successfully.




## Simulation


To simulate this case, it is necessary to register the first address in "My Account > Directions", insert the information of "Datos del Tercero Autorizado", at this moment this behavior will be noticed, where two attempts to save the data will be necessary so that they are, indeed saved.



## Workaround


In these cases, it will be necessary to make two or more attempts to save the data.
