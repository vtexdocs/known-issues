## Summary



The inference of New UI does not work properly to show all itens of order once there is a Partial Invoice or Total Invoice.

If the calculation of total value of order is accomplished with total value of invoices. Even some item is out of the partial invoices items the NEW UI does not show the item pending to invoice.


##

## Simulation




- Create an order and send the partial invoices to reach total value without some item.


##

## Workaround


There is no workaround.
