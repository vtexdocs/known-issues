## Summary


When we query the order value through the UI, it displays a value and when we query it via the Get Orders API, we see a value 0.01 higher. This behavior occurs due to the rounding done in the database. However, this behavior does not impact the total value of the order, it is just a visualization in the ListOrders, the total value of the order is still correct.

Another scenario is to show a value with ".0" in the list orders.


##

## Simulation


Orders with very high values can have this behavior in ListOrders.


##

## Workaround


We don't have a WA yet.

We emphasize that this behavior does not interfere with the value of the order, it is only visual in the listorders.
