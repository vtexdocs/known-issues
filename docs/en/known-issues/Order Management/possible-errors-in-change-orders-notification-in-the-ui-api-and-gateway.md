## Summary

_**Important**: We suggest using the new **Change V2** since the effort went into creating this new feature._

Some problems were identified in the Change Orders V1 architecture, where some cases were not notified in the order interaction in the UI, and were not notified in the Get Orders API, however, there was a discount or increase in the value. We have also seen scenarios where the notification occurs in the UI and API, however, the discount or increase is not made at the gateway.

We have a second point, which is when the change is inserted via MKP and the seller is whitelabel, in these cases, the change may not be replicated on the Seller!
The correct thing to do is to make the change via the seller!

## Simulation

It is not possible to carry out a simulation, as the scenarios are sporadic and generally occur due to a timeout error, for which we have already increased the timer.

## Workaround

Initially, we do not have a workaround.
