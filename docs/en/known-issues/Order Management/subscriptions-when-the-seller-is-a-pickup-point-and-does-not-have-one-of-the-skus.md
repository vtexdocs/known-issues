## Summary



It was identified that in the request for recurrence of a signature with the following scenario:

The Subscription has more than one distinct product/sku, one of these products/sku has no stock and the seller is a pickup point, the following error will be displayed: No item fulfilled simulation conditions to place order.



This occurs because, in all subscription requests, a simulation is performed with the Checkout and in this simulation, we receive the checkout error that one of the products cannot be delivered.




## Simulation



To simulate this scenario, we will have to have a subscription with more than one distinct SKU, the Seller has a Pickup point and one of the SKUs must not have available stock.

1- When the subscription makes the simulation for the recurrence, it will have in the response the status= MISSING for the SKU's;



2- Checking the simulation at checkout, we will have an error that one of the SKUs cannot be delivered and the partial order will not be placed.



3- We will also see that it is not possible to place the order in a partial way.




## Workaround


We have no workaround at the moment.
