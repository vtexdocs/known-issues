## Summary


The orders filter system currently doesn't return the order with promotions that contain double quotes `"` in their names, this also applies to SKU name.


##

## Simulation


To reproduce this scenario, follow the steps below.

1. Create a promotion/sku with double quotes `"` in the name;
Example: Promotion name as `10% off usando o cupom "DIAGEO" (8)`
2. Create a test order:

  1. In the store environment (storefront), select an item and add it to the cart;
  2. Make sure promotion is applied;
  3. Go to the checkout and place the order.
3. Go to **Orders > Order management**;
4. Click on `All orders`;
5. Use the **filter** to select the promotion you've added;
6. Note that no orders are found with the selected filter, and returned message in the UI is: `Nenhum pedido encontrado. Limpe seus filtros e tente uma pesquisa diferente.`
