## Summary



When performing a filter referring to orders within a month (for example, the month of March), there is a small difference between the information in the "`Subscription Orders Funnel`" and the "`Subscription Orders`".






## Simulation



Go to Subscriptions Dashboard > Subscribers. Perform a filter, for example, "Customized - monthly". In "Subscription Orders Funnel" and immediately afterwards make the same filter in "Subscription Orders".

There may be a difference in values in the "Completed" field.






## Workaround



We can understand that the correct answer is contained in the "Subscription Orders" field.
