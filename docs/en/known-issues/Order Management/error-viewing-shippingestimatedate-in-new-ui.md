## Summary



When placing an order with more than one product/SKU with different delivery dates, New_UI takes the (shippingEstimateDate) information from ItemIndex=0, which is in the GET Orders API at "ShippingData">"LogisticsInfo">"ItemIndex", instead of getting the information (shippingEstimateDate) from the ItemIndex with the longest time.




## Simulation



1- Place an order by inserting products/SKUs with different delivery dates (shippingEstimateDate);

2- you will notice that in the New_UI the (shippingEstimateDate) of the ItemIndex=0 is displayed and not of the ItemIndex with the highest (shippingEstimateDate) shown in the Get Orders API.




## Workaround



As a workaround, it is possible to use Old_UI.
