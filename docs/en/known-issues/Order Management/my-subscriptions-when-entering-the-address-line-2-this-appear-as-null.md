## Summary



When My Address has "address line 2" filled in (except Brazil), and we refer to this address in My Subscriptons, the second address is displayed as "Null".




## Simulation



In My Address, when entering a US address, for example, adding to "AddressLine 2". Then go to My Subscriptions to reference this address with "AddressLine 2", the information of "AddressLine 2" is displayed as "Null".




## Workaround



In these cases, we do not have a Workaround.
