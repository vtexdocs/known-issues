## Summary


There is a problem when some clients are trying to see all orders on my account page system. The orders are not available to be displayed because the sub-account is not as active.

Error message:
"An unexpected error has occurred, we are working to resolve it. Try again later."



## Simulation


To reproduce the error you should login as client on my account page and click on my orders, but this problem only happens when the sub-account where the order was made is in inactive state.



## Workaround


The workaround for this error is:
The client can recreate the sub-account related to the order.
