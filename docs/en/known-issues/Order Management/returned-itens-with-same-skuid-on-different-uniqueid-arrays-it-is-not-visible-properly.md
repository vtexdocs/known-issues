## Summary


Our integrated systems (OMS/SNO/UI) was not designed to use the same info for correlation to shows the correct information when an iten with the same SKU was crated on different uniqueid array. It happens because some systems uses skuid and others itemindex.


##

## Simulation


Create an order with a more than one quantity items, creating an order with more than one array of itens with same skuid. Invoice the order and on return pages will be possible to see that the item has no information about diferences between each one.


##

## Workaround


There is no workarround for that.
