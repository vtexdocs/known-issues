## Summary


When a new user registers in **My Account**, the page executes two requests, one sending the data and the other consulting the `userid` of that user, but in this second request the return is 404 not found, and the page displays an error message to the user.



## Simulation


** **

1. Enter the home
2. Access my account with an unregistered user.
3. Log in
4. At this moment, the UI will display an error message "`There was an error communicating with the system, try to reload the page`".
5. In the console, it will be possible to see a _**graphql**_ request for profile system returning 404.



## Workaround


There is no workaround to avoid the error.
NOTE; however, when reloading the page, the flow usually follows.
