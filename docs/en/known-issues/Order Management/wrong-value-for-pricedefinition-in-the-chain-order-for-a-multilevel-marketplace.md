## Summary


The "priceDefinition" property for orders in the "chain" level in a multilevel marketplace isn't following the "sellingPrice" as expected. Instead, it's following the "price" property.


##

## Simulation


Create an order with a discount applied since the marketplace layer (level 1), in relation to the seller layer (chain, level 2), in a multilevel relationship. The fulfillment layer (level 3) will present the values correctly, but the "chain" won't.


##

## Workaround


Avoid using the "priceDefinition" property in these type of orders and do the maths using the price, quantity, unitMultiplier, and priceTag properties – to avoid issues with the "sellingPrice", which isn't a precise value.
