## Summary


There is a case of some addresses that are not possible to be saved in My Account section page in Chile accounts.

When editing my account and entering the address data there is an autocomplete and a map, but after clicking the save button nothing happens.

**Update**:



## Simulation


You should try to save address like the example:

* Av. Arturo Prat Chac√≥n 1099, Iquique

Nothing happens when you click to save the address.




## Workaround


There is no workaround available for that in the My Account itself, but maybe using our Master Data APIs can update or create those addresses.
