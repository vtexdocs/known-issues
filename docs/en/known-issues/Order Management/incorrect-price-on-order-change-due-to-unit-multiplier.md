## Summary


If you add or remove a SKU from an existing order (the change order process) and the SKU has a multiplier unit different from 1, the unit multiplier is not considered for calculating the new order value.


##

## Simulation


- Add or remove the sku with a unit multiplier different from 1 to an existing order. You can check out more about the process here: Changing items from a completed order.
- Notice that the unit multiplier is not considered when calculating the SKU value and the total order value.


##

## Workaround


The change order can be done via API "Register change on order", and the store is responsible for entering the values correctly, according to value and unit multiplier.
