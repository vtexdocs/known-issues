## Summary


The New UI does not shows the customer ID document on orders. For example as CPF, it happens because the accounts trade policy has another country configured.


##

## Simulation


You can set an different country on Trade Policy and make a purchase using this policy configuration on checkout store. Normal process.
After that open the admin and consult the properly order, on client informations you will not see the client document ID.


##

## Workaround


There is no workaround for now.
