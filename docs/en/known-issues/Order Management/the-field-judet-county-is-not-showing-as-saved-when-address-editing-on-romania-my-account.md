## Summary


For stores from Romania on _**My Account**_ page there is a field named "Judet", county in english, that is not showing as saved when editing address.


##

## Simulation



- Checking the My Account address, you can see the previously saved address.
- Then is possible to see the behavior of this field is not the same as the other fields.
- Click on Edit Address and the previous address is still in the fields of address except for Judet.


##

## Workaround


There is no workaround available for that in the My Account itself, but maybe using our Master Data APIs can update or create those addresses.
