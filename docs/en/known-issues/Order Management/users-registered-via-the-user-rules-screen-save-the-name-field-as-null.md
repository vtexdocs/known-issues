## Summary


Users registered via the user rules screen save the name field as null.


##

## Simulation


When you register a new user on the platform, you can register them and then associate them with a pre-existing profile, or you can enter the user's email address on the rules screen, but when you flow through the rules screen, the user is saved with an empty name field


##

## Workaround


To prevent this from happening, the ideal is to use the flow of registering the user on the users screen, and on this same screen associating them with an access profile.

Another option is to ask the user whose registration is in this scenario to enter the user Settings area and register a name for their user.
