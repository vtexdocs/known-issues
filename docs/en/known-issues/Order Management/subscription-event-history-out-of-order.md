## Summary


Currently, the Subscription History in My subscription area , does not display the events in a predefined order, so it can show the events in non-chronological order;


##

## Simulation


Using a subscription that has had more than one order generated;

1-  Enter the history area;
2- The list of events displayed will not be in chronological order;

NOTE: In some cases, the scenario may not be noticed because only a few events are out of chronological order.


##

## Workaround



there is currently no workaround for this behavior
