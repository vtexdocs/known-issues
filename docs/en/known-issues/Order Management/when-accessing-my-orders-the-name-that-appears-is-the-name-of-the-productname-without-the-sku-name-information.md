## Summary


When accessing "my orders", the name that appears is the name of the "ProductName" without the "SKU Name" information, only in the IO interface.



##

## Simulation


Accessing my orders, you will see that the product name is composed only by the "ProductName" without the information of the "SKU Name".


##

## Workaround


We have no workaround at the moment.
