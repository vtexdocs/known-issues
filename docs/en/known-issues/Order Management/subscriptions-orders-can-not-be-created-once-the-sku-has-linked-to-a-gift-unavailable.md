## Summary


There is a condition that the Orders from Subscription cannot be created because it is linked to an **unavailable gift**, even if the items of a subscription are available.


##

## Simulation



- To simulate this, you need a gift (like Promotion **Buy One Get One**) linked to one SKU of subscription, and this gift should be unavailable after the purchase is made and before the next cycle.
- The error on the subscription cycle is "**Could not select a SLA for SKU {SKU ID}**"


##

## Workaround


The way to avoid this scenario is to remove the link of gift out of stock or guarantee that the gift has stock if you want to create a new cycle with the gift.
