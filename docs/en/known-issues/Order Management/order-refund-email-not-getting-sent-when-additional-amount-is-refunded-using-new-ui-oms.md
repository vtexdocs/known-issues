## Summary


When an order is returned by Marketplace through the "new UI" and an "additional" value is inserted into the "new UI", it generates a giftcard erroneously and with that, Checkout returns an error saying "that there is no value to be reversed and the email transactional "vtexcommerce-order-refunded" is not sent to the end customer.


##

## Simulation


To simulate this case, it is necessary to make a refund, adding an extra value through "New_UI".
The sending of the transactional email "vtexcommerce-order-refunded" to the end customer will not be identified.


##

## Workaround


In these cases where the refund occurred in "New_UI", we do not have a workaround. If it is necessary to make a refund, it is possible to do it through Old_UI.
