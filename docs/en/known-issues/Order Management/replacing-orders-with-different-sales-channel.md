## Summary


We have identified that it is not possible to replace a SKU in the order if the Sales Channel (SC), equal to 1, is not available for the account.

For example, account A does not have sales channel=1, only SC=2, in the order replacement request we are sending sales channel=1 and not 2.


##

## Simulation


Account A, does not have sales channel=1, only SC=2, in the order replacement request, when they request the replacement of a SKU, we are sent sales channel=1 and not 2, therefore, it is not possible to carry out the replacement.


##

## Workaround


N/A.
