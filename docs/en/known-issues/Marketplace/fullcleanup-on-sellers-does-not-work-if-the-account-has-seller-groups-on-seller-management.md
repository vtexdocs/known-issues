## Summary


On the Seller Management area the marketplace can group their sellers as they wish and manage them on the group management tab.

However, if they wish to delete all seller data on the fullcleanup area, the process will fail if there are groups created.


#### Simulation



1. Create a seller group on Seller Management;
2. Perform a seller fullcleanup;
3. Check that an error appears.


#### Workaround


First, delete the seller groups manually on the seller management and then try to perform the seller fullcleanup again.
