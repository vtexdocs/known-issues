## Summary


The API Get Matched Offers List , documented here: https://developers.vtex.com/vtex-rest-api/reference/getofferslist, is not working properly when the user tries to insert the query params suggested.

The result brings only one product.



## Simulation



1. Use the API without any params: GET https://{accountName}.{environment}.com.br/api/offer-manager/pvt/offers
2. The result will bring only 1 product as expected.
3. Use the query param "rows": GET https://{accountName}.{environment}.com.br/api/offer-manager/pvt/offers?rows=20
4. The result won't change



## Workaround


Use similar APIs to get the information one product at time:
