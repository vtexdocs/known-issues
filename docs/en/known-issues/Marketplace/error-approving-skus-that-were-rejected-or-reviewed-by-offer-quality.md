## Summary

When a sku fails the Offer Quality rules created by the Marketplace, it goes directly to the "Review Tab" or "Rejected Tab" of Received Skus.

However, when trying to approve the sku, an error message is returned: "Sorry, something went wrong in the Catalog. Please try again or contact VTEX if the problem persists."

This happens because the Matcher module was not able to fill the product and sku information after sending the sku to these Tabs (you can check this using the APIs):

## Simulation

1. Create an optional or mandatory rule on Offer Quality;
2. Wait for a sku to fail the rule and go to the Review/Rejected Tab;
3. Try to approve the sku and get an error message;
4. Check via API if the matches object is filled like the image above.

## Workaround

Approve the sku via API passing the correct product and sku information manually.
