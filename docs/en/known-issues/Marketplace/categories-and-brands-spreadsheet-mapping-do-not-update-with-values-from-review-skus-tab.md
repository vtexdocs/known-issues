## Summary


When a seller sends to the marketplace a sku with a category or brand that is not yet mapped on the spreadsheet, the spreadsheet is updated with this new value on the 3rd column in order to be mapped.

If the sku is sent to the Review tab, this update is not happening.


##

## Simulation



1. Seller sends a sku with a not mapped brand/category to the marketplace;
2. Sku fails some optional rule on the offer quality;
3. Sku goes to the review tab;
4. Check that the mapping spreadsheet is not updated.
