## Summary


The Received Skus search feature allows the marketplace to search for a product or sku by the following criteria:
- Sku Name;
- ID;
- EAN.

Currently, the EAN search is not behaving as expected by not giving any results.


##

## Simulation


Try to find a sku by searching for it using it's EAN.
The result should be the sku instead of a blank area.


##

## Workaround


Use the other search criteria, such as Sku Name or ID.
