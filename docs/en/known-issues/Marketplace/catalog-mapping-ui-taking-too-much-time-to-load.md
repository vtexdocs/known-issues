## Summary


When the marketplace has a lot of sellers and use the mapping spreadsheets to the majority of them, the Catalog Mapping UI might be to heavy and each time the merchant tries to access it, it takes a lot of time to load.
Also, the usability is harmed.


##

## Simulation



1. The account needs to have a large amount of sellers;
2. For each seller, add it to the mapping area of the Catalog Mapping UI;
3. Verify that the time to load of this page is increased and the usability is not great.


##

## Workaround


No workaround for mapping categories and brands. To map specification is also possible using API:
