## Summary


When trying to filter the skus on the Received Skus module, the marketplace can choose to filter by seller, category and/or brand.

However, when selecting a brand that has special characters (like "&" or "+") the result is that there are no skus in that filter, which is not actually correct.


##

## Simulation



1. Filter by one of the options on the Received Skus module;
2. Select a value with special character;
3. Check that the result is no skus;
4. Now search by the value on the search and check that in fact there are some skus.


##

## Workaround


No workaround to fix the filter, but using the search could bring a close result of the skus.
