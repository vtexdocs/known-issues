## Summary



The seller can send unitMultilplier values for it's skus that are bellow 1.

Example:
 ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vtexdocs/known-issues/refs/heads/main/docs/en/known-issues/Marketplace/suggestions-transforming-unitmultiplier-less-than-1-to-0_1.png)

The same info is sent to the marketplace correctly:
 ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vtexdocs/known-issues/refs/heads/main/docs/en/known-issues/Marketplace/suggestions-transforming-unitmultiplier-less-than-1-to-0_2.png)

However, once the product is processed by the Matcher, the value is rounded to 0:
 ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vtexdocs/known-issues/refs/heads/main/docs/en/known-issues/Marketplace/suggestions-transforming-unitmultiplier-less-than-1-to-0_3.png)

And once is approved to the marketplace catalog, the value continues as 0. That way a wrong value is set on the marketplace's catalog.


##

## Simulation



1. Create a sku with a unitMultiplier value as less than 1;
2. Send it to the marketplace;
3. Approve the sku on the marketplace's received skus area;
4. Check on the marketplace's catalog that the value is set as 0.


##

## Workaround


Adjust the value directly on the marketplace's catalog via Admin, spreadsheet or API.
