## Summary



The seller logo information on the database is not being saved as an URL, but as an Image.

Currently our orderform documentation states that this field is supposed to be an URL:
https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/orderform-fields#sellers
 ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vtexdocs/known-issues/refs/heads/main/docs/en/known-issues/Marketplace/seller-logo-not-being-saved-as-an-url_1.png)

But on our database is being saved in a different format.



##

## Simulation



1. Set a logo for a seller via UI or API;
2. Check via GET Seller API (https://developers.vtex.com/docs/api-reference/marketplace-apis#get-/-accountName-.-environment-.com.br/api/seller-register/pvt/sellers/-sellerId-) the format of the field "UrlLogo".
3. Check on the orderform it also won't be an URL.

## Workaround


No workaround.
