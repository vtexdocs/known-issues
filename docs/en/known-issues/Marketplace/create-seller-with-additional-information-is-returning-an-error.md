`The seller has been successfully added, but some information could not be saved.`

Despite the message, the seller was not actually saved.

## Simulation

1. Go to seller management and click create new seller;
2. Fulfill all the information mandatory;
3. Fulfill at least one information that is optional on the section Additional Information;
4. Check that the error message will appear.

## Workaround

First create the seller without the Additional Information.
After the seller is created successfully, go back to it's setup and fulfill the Additional Information.
