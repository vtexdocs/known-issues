## Summary


When using the new seller experience UI, /admin/sellers, the action of inactivating a seller should reindex its related products so they can be removed from the associated marketplaces, which isn't currently happening.


##

## Simulation


Access the aforementioned UI and, for a store that is integrating with a marketplace, with an affiliate endpoint (https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/como-configurar-afiliado--tutorials_187) and then try inactivating a seller available for this same trade policy.

The items, in the marketplace, will not be updated.


##

## Workaround


Either reindex the base or use the legacy seller UI ( https://accountname.vtexcommercestable.com.br/admin/site/seller.aspx), which does trigger the indexing properly.
