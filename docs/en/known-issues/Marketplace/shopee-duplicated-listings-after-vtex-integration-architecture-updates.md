## Summary


Some sellers with an active integration prior to 2024 are experiencing duplicated product listings on Shopee following the migration performed in March/25. The duplicates have different _item IDs_ but represent the same SKUs.




#### Simulation



- Access the Shopee seller portal.
- Look for product listings with identical names, SKUs, and descriptions, but different _item IDs_


#### Workaround


Sellers can request Shopee to delete the extra duplicated SKU entries directly from the marketplace.
