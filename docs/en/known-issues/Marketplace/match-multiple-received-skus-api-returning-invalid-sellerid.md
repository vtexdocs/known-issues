## Summary


The Match Multiple Received SKUs API (doc: https://developers.vtex.com/vtex-rest-api/reference/match-received-skus#matchmultiple) is returning the error message "Invalid sellerId" for any attempt of approving new products, even if the seller is correctly active on the marketplace.


##

## Simulation


1. Copy the curl of the previous documentation;
2. Paste it on your API tool (postman, insomnia...);
3. Replace the object values with the data from the sku you're trying to approve;
4. Check if the sellerId is active and valid on the marketplace's seller management;
5. The API response should not be:

    "errorResponse": { "Code": 33, "Message": "Invalid sellerId"        }




##

## Workaround


The Match Received SKUs individually API is working correctly and can replace the previous API to approve new products one by one.
