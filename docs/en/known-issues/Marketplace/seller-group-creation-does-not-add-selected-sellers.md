## Summary


The marketplace can create groups with some sellers on the Seller Management UI.
 ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vtexdocs/known-issues/refs/heads/main/docs/en/known-issues/Marketplace/seller-group-creation-does-not-add-selected-sellers_1.png)

However, when adding a group name and sellers on this UI, only the group name is being saved. An error message appears:
"Sorry, something went wrong when adding the sellers to the XXX group."

##

## Simulation



1. Go the Seller Management area and click on Manage groups;
2. Click on Add Group and add the information like name and sellers;
3. Check that the group is created but without any sellers.


##

## Workaround


Add the sellers to the group manually later on their "Seller Details" UI
