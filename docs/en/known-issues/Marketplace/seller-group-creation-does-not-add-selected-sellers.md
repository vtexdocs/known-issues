## Summary


The marketplace can create groups with some sellers on the Seller Management UI.

However, when adding a group name and sellers on this UI, only the group name is being saved. An error message appears:
"Sorry, something went wrong when adding the sellers to the XXX group."

##

## Simulation



1. Go the Seller Management area and click on Manage groups;
2. Click on Add Group and add the information like name and sellers;
3. Check that the group is created but without any sellers.


##

## Workaround


Add the sellers to the group manually later on their "Seller Details" UI
