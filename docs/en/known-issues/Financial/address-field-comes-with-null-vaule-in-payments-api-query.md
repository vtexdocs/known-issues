## Summary

The `address` field comes with `null` value when we query through the Payment's API.

## Simulation

The problem is intermittent. However, just close a purchase and check in the Payments query API if the `address` field was filled in correctly, or if it returned the null information again.

API for tests:
`https://{AccountName}.vtexpayments.com.br/api/pvt/transactions/{TransactionId}/payments`

## Workaround

Currently there's no workaround for this problem.
