## Summary

If a customer places an order with the notes payable payment method and the payment is not made, the transaction is not cancelled by the gateway after the payment due date. Consequently, since the OMS cannot identify the cancellation event, the order is not cancelled.

## Simulation

1. In the Admin, go to the notes payable affiliation settings.
2. In the **expiration date** field, enter `1` and click __Save__.
3. Place an order with the notes payable payment method.
4. Note that the transaction is not automatically cancelled after the notes payable expires.

## Workaround

Currently, there is no workaround for this scenario.
