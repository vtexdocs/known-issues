## Summary


The script of the platform that operates the live shopping app (NIZZA) has specifically interfered with a pixel app called Handtalk.


#### Simulation


To simulate this, simply access the page that has the Handtalk pixel app installed. When you click on the pixel app's sign language icon, the translation character does not load, leaving a blank screen.

When you block the NIZZA script through the network, the pixel app returns to normal operation.or attachments.


#### Workaround


N/A
