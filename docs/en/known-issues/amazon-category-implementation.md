## Summary


We are having below errors when trying to integrate some SKUs, we have tested with global categories: 166, 167 e 169 none of them are working, but these categories should be available in Amazon.

Erro "Category 169 not found in browse node mapping for SKU's department specification, choose a more specific global category" persistente
## Simulation



Inside bridge products we can see below error:

Erro "Category 169 not found in browse node mapping for SKU's department specification, choose a more specific global category" persistente

Change global category, until we fix this one.
