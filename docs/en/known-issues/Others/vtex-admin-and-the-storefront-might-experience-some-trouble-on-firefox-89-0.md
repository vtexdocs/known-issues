## Summary

VTEX Admin might not load some modules on Firefox 89.0 due to the new `Enhanced Tracking Protection` option in the browser, which is turned on by default. 

This problem may also affect the storefront and the checkout page, when end-customers access the store through Firefox 89.0.


## Simulation

If you, or your store’s customers have updated your Firefox browser to the 89.0 version, it is likely that your storefront and some VTEX Admin modules may not load. 


## Workaround

To fix this issue, you should turn off the tracking toggle: 

1. Access your **VTEX Admin, or storefront** through Firefox 89.0.  
2. Click on the **shield icon**, next to the url.   
3. Turn **off** the `Enhanced Tracking protection is ON for this site` toggle.   

Don’t worry: turning off this option will not make your store unprotected.

>ℹ️ If after these steps your Admin or store is still not loading, we advise you to try another browser.
