## Summary


The sales channel configured in B2B Organizations Settings is not saved in the Organization Details.


##

## Simulation



- Configure a default sales channel in B2B Organizations Settings;
- Create an Organization Request;
- Approve the Organization Request;
- Check the Organization details; it won't have any sales channel assigned.


##

## Workaround



- Assign the sales channel to the organization via admin;
- Create a trigger for the organizations entity's schema:

    "v-triggers": [{ "name": "define-salesChannel-default", "active": true, "condition": "salesChannel is null", "action": { "type": "save", "dataEntity": "organizations", "json": { "id": "{!id}", "salesChannel": "{add here the salesChannelId defined in B2B Organizations Settings}" } } }]
