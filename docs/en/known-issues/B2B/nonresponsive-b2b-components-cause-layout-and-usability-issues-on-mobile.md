## Summary


Some native B2B app components are not responsive on mobile, leading to broken layouts and poor usability in areas like My Quotes and Organization Cost Centers. Symptoms include overlapping address fields, off-screen toggles, truncated labels/buttons, hidden input text, and inconsistent locale strings.


#### Simulation


Access My Account > Organization > Cost Centers on a mobile device. Observe addresses overlap, text overflow, and CTAs overflowing containers.


#### Workaround


Implement custom styling/overrides on the merchant’s theme.
