## Summary


It's possible to use shipping rates using postal codes or geocoordinates, but B2B Organizations use only postal codes to calculate region IDs. If an account has geolocation (polygons) registered in its shipping rates, products will be shown as unavailable on the storefront.


##

## Simulation



- Register shipping rates with polygons;
- Create an organization;
- Log in in the store;
- No product is shown.

## Workaround
