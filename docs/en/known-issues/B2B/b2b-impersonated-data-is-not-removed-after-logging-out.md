## Summary


Logging out after impersonating a user in B2B Suite doesn't remove the storefront-permissions from the session.

This allows the user to navigate the website and even place orders if the impersonated user has access to checkout.


##

## Simulation



- Login with a user with impersonating roles;
- Impersonate another user;
- Logout.


##

## Workaround


Click "Stop Impersonation" to remove the impersonated data from the session.
