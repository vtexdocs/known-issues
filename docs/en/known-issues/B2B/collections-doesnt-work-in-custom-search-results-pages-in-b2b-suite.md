## Summary


Custom search results pages set up with collection id don't work when a different product Collections are assigned to an organization.

The expected behavior when using Collections is to define the assortment of products the organization users will see in the storefront, but since B2B Organizations also use `productClusterId` in the search, when accessing custom search results pages set up with a different `productClusterId`, the search results show products from both collections.


##

## Simulation



- Set up a product Collections to an organization;
- Create a custom search results page with a different collection;
- Log in and access the custom search result page; products from both collections are shown.
