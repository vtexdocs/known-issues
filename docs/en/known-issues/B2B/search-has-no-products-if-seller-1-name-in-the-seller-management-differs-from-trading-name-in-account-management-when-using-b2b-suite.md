## Summary


B2B organizations use the sellers' names from the Seller Management. If an organization has seller 1 assigned, the name saved will be from Seller Management, but no products may be shown in the search if it differs from the trading name in Account Management.


##

## Simulation



- Have an account with seller 1 named in Seller Management different from the trading name in Account Management;
- Create a B2B Organization and assign the seller 1;
- Login to the account; no products are shown.


##

## Workaround


**This issue has been fixed in version** `vtex.b2b-organizations@1.35.0`**, released on September 10th. All sellers associated after the release will be correct, but associations before that must still apply the workaround.**

- Access GraphQL IDE and select vtex.b2b-organizations-graphql;
- Use the query below to get all the organization details:

    { getOrganizationById(id:"insert here the organization id"){ id name tradeName status collections{ id name } paymentTerms{ id name } priceTables customFields{ name type value dropdownValues{ value label } useOnRegistration } salesChannel sellers { id name } }}

- Send a mutation to update the seller name for seller 1 using the information retrieved above:

    mutation { updateOrganization( id: "" name: "" tradeName: "" status: "active" collections: [{ id: "" name: "" }] paymentTerms: [{ id: "" name: "" }] priceTables: [""] customFields: [] salesChannel: "" sellers: [{ id: "1", name: "trade name from Account Management" }] ){ id status message }}
