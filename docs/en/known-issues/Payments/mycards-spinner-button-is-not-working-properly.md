## Summary


After clicking on the "Save new card" button, users expect to see some feedback indicating that something is processing. Unfortunately, the current experience is lacking, as the button does not display the expected "spinner" animation. This can be frustrating for users and detracts from the overall user experience.

This component is currently using vtex/styleguide@9.145.1, but our latest version is 9.146.3. It's possible that the issue you're experiencing is a bug in the version being used.
