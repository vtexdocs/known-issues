## Summary


When a new user enters a new email at the email step and proceeds to the next page, in the customer data component, the email isn't automatically filled in.
This is because there's no registered user with that email. As a result, the loaded `orderForm` also contains an empty email field, causing it to remain blank and requiring the customer to re-enter their email.


##

## Simulation



1. Navigate to the checkout page where customers enter their email.
2. Put an email never used before in the store.
3. Go to the client profile component.
4. The email box will be empty, and then you have to type it again.
