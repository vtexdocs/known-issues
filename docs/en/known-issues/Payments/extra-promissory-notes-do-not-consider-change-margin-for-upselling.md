## Summary


The max value for upselling is only calculated for default promissory notes, when adding extra ones, our gateway does not consider the changing margin range field in the calculation



## Simulation


Place an order using any default slots for promissory notes and then place a new order after adding and using new slots for promissory



## Workaround


In the case of using the change margin range field, this field only works for the first five default slots
