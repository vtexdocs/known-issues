## Summary


When attempting to add a new provider id for the first time on an account, instead of adding a new provider, the current native provider (VtexGiftCard) gets updated.


##

## Simulation


Use our API to update a provider when the account has never added a new provider.


##

## Workaround


To add a new provider, you must first save the information of our native gift card provider. Once you have saved the info, you can then add the new provider successfully.
