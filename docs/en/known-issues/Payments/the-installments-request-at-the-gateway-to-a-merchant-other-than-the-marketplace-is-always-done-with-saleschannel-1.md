## Summary


Requests to get external installments at the gateway to a merchant other than the marketplace are always made with salesChannel = 1.
The behavior was observed in a Seller-whitelabel scenario for a franchise account, but it also seems applicable to the context of common sellers, to the foreign market.

**Expected behavior**
Requests made from the marketplace to a seller's gateway/merchant must follow the fulfillment endpoint's business policy in order to maintain context.

**current behavior**
Even though the "fulfillment endpoint" is done with salesChannel=2, the installments request is done in the context of salesChannel=1.



## Simulation



1. Choose a seller whose final destination is different from salesChannel=1
2. Simulate a cart with an item from this seller
3. Observe the request for installments that is made to the Merchant of this seller.
