## Summary


When a more for less promotion (or any promotion that splits items) is applied in B2B Quotes for a SKU, once you go to checkout, the first group of the SKU splitted will remain in the cart, but the second won't. In other words, cart checkout miscalculates the total units for the SKU.


#### Simulation



- Create a quote with 12 units of a SKU that has a more for less promotion applied for each 10 units.
- The B2B Quotes app will split the SKU in 1 item with 10 units (and the promotion applied) and 1 item with 2 units (with the total price without promotion).
- Go to checkout.
- The first item with 10 units will appear at checkout, the second (with 2 units) won't.


#### Workaround


NA
