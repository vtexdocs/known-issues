## Summary



The checkout `orderForm` is showing wrong currency (BRL instead of USD) when we have two different rules for two trade polices (Brazil and USA) with PayPal connector. Clients are not able to change to correct currency. Therefore when placing the order, even though the correct rule is matched, we got an error:

_(400) Bad Request., detail: _
_{"message": "Currency of capture must be the same as currency of authorization"...}_
