## Summary


When the user searches a transaction in the admin by the sequence number, in some cases, the return is the desired transaction and unrelated transaction with chargeback status.



## Simulation


If the store has transactions in chargeback status and the user fetches it with the sequence number.



## Workaround


Use transactionId or paymentId instead.
