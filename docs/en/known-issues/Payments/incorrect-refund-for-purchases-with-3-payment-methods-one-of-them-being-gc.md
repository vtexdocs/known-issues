## Summary


Transactions with 3 payment methods being one of their gift card have incorrect refund amounts. In some cases we have a negative refund which causes the payment to be canceled.

Thread with the discussion



## Simulation


The procedure appears to be random, we realized that the negative refund amount is the total amount requested - the payment methods that were correctly refunded - the GC amount.
In the case that above:
Payment 1(American express): 66,99 BRL
Payment 2(Diners): 67,00 BRL
**Payment 3(GC): 30,99 BRL**

Refund requested: 104.99 BRL

**Refund on giftcard: 30,99 BRL**
Refund on American express: 66,99 BRL
Refund on Diners: -23,98 BRL

The negative value in the Diners refund is (104,99 - 30,99 -  66,99 - **30,99**) = -23,98.
What appears to be is that somehow the value of the GC is being discounted twice.



## Workaround


There is no workaround for this bug
