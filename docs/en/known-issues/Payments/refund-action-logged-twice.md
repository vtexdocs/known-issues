## Summary


In some cases two refund actions can happen in the transaction but none of them is sent to acquirer.

When a refund request fails there's no retry, a `CreateTaskAsyncRequest` sends an email notification to merchant about the error and a manual refund must be requested to acquirer. In this case the refund is logged with `type` = `email-notification`, a successful refund would be `online`, both should never happen in a normal scenario.
