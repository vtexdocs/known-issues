## Summary


Gift Card payments are not created with a `currencyCode`, as consequence the transactions will be created with the default R$ (Brazilian Real), this doesn't happen when another payment method is present (e.g. Gift Card + Credit Card).


##

## Simulation


Place an order using Gift Card only, the transaction will be in R$ but the order is created correctly with local currency. The issue is only visual, no operational impact.


##

## Workaround
