## Summary


There have been instances where certain transactions are being declined during the anti-fraud analysis due to the null value in the `minicart.buyer.id` field. Thus, the `minicart.buyer.id` is expected to be sent from the checkout to the gateway through `sendAdditionalData`. However, according to the current checkout architecture, there is no specific requirement to provide this field in `sendAdditionalData`, and its definition may or may not be available at a later stage.


##

## Simulation


It's not possible to reproduce this behavior once this is intermittent.


##

## Workaround


It is possible to send the additional data afterward through our API:
