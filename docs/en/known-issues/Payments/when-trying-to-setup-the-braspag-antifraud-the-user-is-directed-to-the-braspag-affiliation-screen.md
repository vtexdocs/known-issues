## Summary


We have two internal integrations with Braspag, one for anti-fraud and the other for an affiliation (both with the same name). When trying to click on anti-fraud to configure, the user is directed to the affiliation configuration fields. So it is not possible to configure Braspag anti-fraud through the Admin UI



## Simulation



1. Go to Affiliation settings in the admin
2. Trying to create a new Braspag anti-fraud afiliation
3. The form opened is the affiliation configuration and not anti-fraud configuration



## Workaround


The workaround is to configure the anti-fraud via API
