## Summary


Using the special conditions in the payment method to filter the issuer is causing the checkout to display an error "Issuing bank is not accepted". The problem is intermittent and was first noticed when using the Custom Payment Co-branded card but it also happened in the Credit Card Payment Method.



## Simulation


N/A



## Workaround


Remove the issuing bank's Special condition from the Payment condition.
