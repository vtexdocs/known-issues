## Summary


There's an issue to approve some transactions that is related to the Konduto anti-fraud system. This issue arises when the system fails to make the necessary request due to the absence of the accountId, which is required to retrieve payment information from the account database. You can verify this by examining the "/payment" route, where you will find the node "usedAccountId" with a value of "False" in such cases.

**{**"name": "usedAccountId","value": "False"**}**

Furthermore, this problem is commonly observed when a user removes their own card from the MyAccount page immediately after placing an order.
