## Summary


There are only two ways to change the `isValueChangeable` field for a transaction: when a split occurs, and when the `maximumValue` is equal to the `minimumValue`. Furthermore, it's worth noting that every transaction is created with a `minimumValue` of 0.01. As a result, when a transaction is created with a value of 0.01, the `isValueChangeable` field is automatically set to `false`.


##

## Simulation


Create a transaction with a value of 0.01 and access the /capabilities route.
