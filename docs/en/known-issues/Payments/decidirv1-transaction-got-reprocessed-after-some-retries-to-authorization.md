## Summary


This happens when a transaction gets the status 480 which means "REVIEW", and starts to retry until it receives a null payload. So, after that, we "reprocessed" the transaction which causes a failure and cancelation.



## Simulation


There's no way to simulate this.



## Workaround


No workaround is available at this time
