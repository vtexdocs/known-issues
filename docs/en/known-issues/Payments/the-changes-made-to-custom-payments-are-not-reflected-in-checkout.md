## Summary


When the customer tries to modify the settings made for custom payments that already have an associated payment rule, the changes are not reflected at checkout.
The problem happens because of a cache that needs to be overwritten by the changes made in Custom payment configuration.



## Simulation



1. Go to the VTEX **Admin**.
2. Set up a Custom payment.
3. Set up a Payment condition for process the Custom payment.
4. Go back to the Custom payment setup and change the description there.
5. Go to checkout and note that the update did not reflect the changes you made.

You can work around this issue by saving the Payment condition that is associated with the Custom payment
