## Summary


Merchants can experience a bug when creating a Custom Payment, after filling everything and hit save the message `Custom payment was configured successfully!` appears but the creation actually failed (it doesn't appear in UI).


##

## Simulation


Go to Custom Payments tab and configure any payment rule, you may experience the issue above.


##

## Workaround


The only workaround would be retrying the creation until it appears in UI.
