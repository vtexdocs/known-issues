## Summary


The PIX payment countdown timer in Checkout stops decreasing when the browser tab is minimized or the user leaves the page.

Users see the timer freeze and only resume when they return to the tab.


#### Simulation



- Prerequisites: Any store with PIX enabled in Checkout
- Steps:
  - Go to Checkout and select PIX as the payment method; generate the QR code.
  - Minimize the browser tab or switch away from it for at least 5â€“10 minutes.
  - Return to the tab and observe that the timer did not count down while the tab was in the background, resuming only upon reactivation.


#### Workaround


There is no workaround available.
