## Summary



When we use the browser/OS in italian, alongside with the admin in italian, the fields "Transaction Status" and "Transaction Data" show up in the UI only with the variable's placeholders, and not the data of those variables.

Without changing the language of the browser we are not able to simulate the error,  not in italian or any other language; however it is possible that it happens if other languages are configured.



## Simulation


1. Change the language of the browser to italian (If using Mac/Linux, its necessary to change the Operational System language)
2. Change the language of the admin to italian
3. Enter the Transaction Page on the admin




## Workaround


Changing the language of the browser or the admin
