## Summary


For some reason, when trying to open a new account for specific clients through the API, it returns the following error:

{
"code": 1099,
"message": "The Credit Account is already open."
}


In this scenario, the data of the client (Name, document, etc.) has never been used before on any other account.


##

## Simulation


This happens inconsistently, so it will only happen every other attempt.


##

## Workaround


Create the account via Admin UI.
