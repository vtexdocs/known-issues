## Summary


Customers are receiving an error when trying to pay with Gift Cards when the date of the purchase matches with the expiration date.



## Simulation


1. Create a gift card that expires the next day you create it.
2. Wait until UTC marks 0:00h. For example, in Chile, it would be at 8:00 pm (UTC-4).



## Workaround


The client needs to create the gift card using the API https://developers.vtex.com/vtex-rest-api/reference/gift-card#creategiftcard-1 and then manually chooses the date and hour.
