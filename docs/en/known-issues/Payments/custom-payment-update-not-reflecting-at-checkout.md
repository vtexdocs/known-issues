## Summary


Updates made in custom payments (e.g. name) are saved successfully in admin but may not reflect at checkout (even after waiting 10 minutes).


##

## Simulation


We were not able to simulate as it happens randomly.


##

## Workaround


Change any field information (erase and insert back) and save the rule, after some time it will update at checkout.
