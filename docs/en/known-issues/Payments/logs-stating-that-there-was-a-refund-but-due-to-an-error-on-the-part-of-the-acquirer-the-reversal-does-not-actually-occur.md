## Summary


Even with transaction logs informing that the chargeback was made, an error occurred in the acquirer.
To check the behavior it is possible to see that in the transaction events there is a reversal message:

Reversal of xx,xx (currency)

Looking for the TID on the acquirer's dashboard, it is possible to prove that the chargeback was not made if there is an error message in the cancellation.




## Simulation


Cannot simulate.



## Workaround


Send the list with the TID to the OPS team and, in case of partial cancellation, inform the amount to be reversed so that they can contact the acquirer and in this way forward this list so that they can manually reverse it on their side and I will return with the cancellation letters for each of these orders so that we have proof of cancellation.
