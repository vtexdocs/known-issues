## Summary


Although we have "Gift card viewer" and "View Gift Cards" resources in "GiftCard" Product (Account Settings > User Roles) both allow users to create and edit Gift Cards.

##

## Simulation


Enable the roles mentioned above for a test user, both will allow Gift Cards creation and edition.

As this module has a dependency with Catalog the "Gift/Refund Vouchers" resource (Catalog > Marketing) needs to be active as well.


##

## Workaround


NA
