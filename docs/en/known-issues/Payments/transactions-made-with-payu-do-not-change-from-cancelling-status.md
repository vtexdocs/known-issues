## Summary


When the transaction enters a **canceling** status it's not possible to recognize therefore it does not change to **canceled**.
The PayU connector send the following error: Response code: PENDING_TRANSACTION_REVIEW - AcquirerMessage : PENDING_REVIEW



## Simulation


This error does not happen in all accounts, but it's possible to find filtering the transaction with canceling status.




## Workaround


The workaround is to call manually the API: https://developers.vtex.com/vtex-developer-docs/reference/transaction-flow#cancelthetransaction
