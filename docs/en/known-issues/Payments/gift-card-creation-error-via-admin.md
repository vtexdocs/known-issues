Some accounts won't be able to create a Gift Card for the first time via admin, the message below will appear in the screen:

`Something went wrong`
`Error connecting to the backend server.`
`Please, return to our store in an few moments.`


##

## Simulation


This is only replicable in stores facing this issue, after filling all Gift Card information and pressing the `Save` button users will see the error message mentioned above.

If the first Gift Card is created via API the error will stop ocurring, merchants will be able to create Gift Cards via admin normally after that.
