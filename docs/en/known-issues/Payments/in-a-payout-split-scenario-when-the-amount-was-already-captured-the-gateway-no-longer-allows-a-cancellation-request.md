## Summary


For a split scenario, when the user makes a change order or even a simple cancelation after the payment has already been captured, the gateway no longer allows receiving a new UpdateAdditionalData.
So, in this case, the gateway will throw an exception called PayoutSplitWasAlreadyDone.


##

## Simulation


Try canceling a transaction along with an updateAdditionalData after the transaction has captured its payment.


##

## Workaround


Finish the transaction by capturing the remaining amount and then perform a total or partial refund of the transaction amount.
