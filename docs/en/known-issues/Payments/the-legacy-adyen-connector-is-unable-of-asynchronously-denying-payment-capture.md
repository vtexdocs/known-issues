## Summary


The legacy Adyen connector captures the payment whenever it receives the `"response":"[capture-received]"` field. However, this event only indicates that the capture has been received and will be processed asynchronously. This behavior prevents captures from being denied, as the asynchronous notification encounters an already captured payment and does not refund it.


##

## Simulation


It depends on Adyen's capture response; therefore, a payment needs to be captured to receive a capture-failed notification.


##

## Workaround


N/A
