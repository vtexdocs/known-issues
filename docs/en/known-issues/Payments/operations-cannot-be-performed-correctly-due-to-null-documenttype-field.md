## Summary

Some providers necessarily need `documentType` to be different from `null`, that is, to be correctly filled in to carry out some payment operations.

So far we have two known scenarios:

1. The absence of this field does not allow the payment to be correctly analyzed by anti-fraud, which causes the transaction to be at risk.
2. The absence of the field prevents the payment from being authorized and consequently leads to the transaction being canceled.

## Simulation

This issue occurs when a client uses information from a company to complete an order.
If the company name is used to complete the transaction, the `documentType` field is left unfilled, causing problems with the approval for the payment.

## Workaround

For the first scenario, it is possible to use an internal API to skip the anti-fraud analysis step.
Despite being strongly discouraged, it is a possible operation.
