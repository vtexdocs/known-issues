## Summary


The legacy connectors, ERedeRest and E-Rede V2, initiate cancellations by sending a request to the provider and expect a "returnCode":"359" indicating a successful cancellation. Any other code is interpreted by our gateway as an undefined status, causing the transaction to get stuck in a cancelling state. Even though in some cases, the refund/cancellation request is successful. This led to repeated cancellation attempts, even when the cancellation had already been processed by the provider.


##

## Simulation


It cannot be simulated as we depend on the provider's response.


##

## Workaround


If the payment on the provider side is already canceled

    {"returnCode":"355","returnMessage":"Transaction already cancelled."}

The product support team has the option to utilize an internal API, '`force-cancel-status`', to update the payment and transaction status to 'canceled.'
