## Summary


After conducting some empirical tests, we have observed that the /transaction route in the native gift card API, is sometimes returning a 500 error code while adding the credit requested, which is an unexpected behavior. Furthermore, we have noticed that the request is taking longer than expected to receive a response, indicating a timeout behavior. As a result, there is no effective lock in place to ensure that the card balance will not be credited in this scenario.
