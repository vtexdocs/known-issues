## Summary


We aren't accepting NPS response with more than 65536 characters



## Simulation


Make a purchase with more than 223 items using the NPS connector. The gateway does not support orderList so long and shows this message:

Message: Unknown Error on AutoSettleThe maximum message size quota for incoming messages (65536) has been exceeded. To increase the quota, use the MaxReceivedMessageSize property on the appropriate binding element.



## Workaround


There is no workaround.
