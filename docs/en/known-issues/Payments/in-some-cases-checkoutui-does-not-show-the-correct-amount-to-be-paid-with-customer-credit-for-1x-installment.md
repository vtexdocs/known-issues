## Summary


For a scenario where Customer Credit is used to pay an amount less than the total value of the cart; it shows, for 1x installment in the dropdown, the full amount ignoring debits considered such as paying with another payment method like a gift card.

This is a client-side issue only, therefore, if the user places an order using this option from the dropdown menu, the checkout API will send the correct value to the gateway.


##

## Simulation



- Make sure the account has payment conditions with 1x installment for customer credit;
- Go to the payment part in the checkout pipeline, then chose customer credit as a payment method along with a gift card. Hence, notice that the value in the dropdown appears incorrectly.
