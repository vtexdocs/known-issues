## Summary


For Spanish accounts we can see the button “cancel” on MyCards page but it should have “cancelar” written, since the website is in Spanish. The other buttons and message are in Spanish already.



## Simulation



1. You need to make a purchase with credit card
2. Then access MyCards into MyAccount page
3. Delete a card
4. The message appear but the cancel button is in English



## Workaround
