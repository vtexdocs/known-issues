## Summary


We have a validation issue in the ClientId field on the Giftcards screen. The field that was originally called CPF/CNPJ in Portuguese, was translated to English as clientId. But, when the user wants to create a new Giftcard through UI, the field is automatically formatted by inserting the characters ".", "-" and "/" to make the data entered comply with CPF or CNPJ standards



## Simulation



1. Go to a test account and change the language to English and open the Giftcards page
2. Create a new Giftcard by filling in any number in the clientId field and you will see that the numbers will automatically be formatted



## Workaround


The workaround is to create giftCards through API
