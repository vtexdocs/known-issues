## Summary


In some operations, the native AdyenV1 connector is not sending the `pspsReference` code to Adyen. Since this field is mandatory for this integration, we receive an error response when it is missing.

The reason for the absence of this field is under investigation.


##

## Simulation


Place an order with the Adyen Connector and try to cancel it.


##

## Workaround


N/A.
