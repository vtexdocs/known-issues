## Summary


When using loyalty gift card users can face bad experience when selecting the option "Use only part of the value", there's no "Add" button after filling "Value to use" (the input is automatically accepted) so if a value is not filled fast enough it will be updated with the first digits only making the user to repeat the procedure. This experience is worse via mobile website.
