## Summary


In a Payout Split scenario, when there is a partial cancellation before the capture, we do not change the recipient fields so that the values for when each participant will receive are different from the correct one, that is, the values within the settlement recipients appear as if there had been no partial cancellation.

##


## Simulation


1. Make a purchase with a seller's product on a marketplace.
2. Make a partial cancellation after approval but before capture.
3. Check that the values in the recipients within the settlement request are the original values, not counting the partial cancellation




## Workaround


There is no workaround.
