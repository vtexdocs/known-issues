## Summary


Our Gift Card hub API is adding an extra backslash to the request when calling providers. This is caused by the way we convert the serviceUrl and concatenate it with the URL provided by the connector.



## Simulation


Register a new provider in /giftcardproviders and perform a request in one of the APIs, e.g. /giftcards/_serach. The hub will call the provider and add a "/" like https://baseUrl**//**giftcard/_search.



## Workaround


It's necessary to handle this issue on the provider side.
