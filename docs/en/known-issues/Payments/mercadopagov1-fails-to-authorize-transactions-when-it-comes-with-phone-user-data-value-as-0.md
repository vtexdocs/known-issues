## Summary


If the client's checkout sends user data without proper validation, such as a phone number with fewer than three digits, this data is passed to the gateway as is, which can cause unexpected errors during processing. For example, our parser may trigger an exception and cancel the transaction.


##

## Simulation


To simulate this issue, we used our legacy MercadoPagoV1 connector to place an order and passed user phone data with less than three digits.


##

## Workaround


Unfortunately, there is no workaround at this time. To avoid this issue, we recommend ensuring that all user data is properly validated before being sent to the gateway.
