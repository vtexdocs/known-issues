## Summary


The ClearSale antifraud connector uses the item name as a condition when looping through the mini cart sent by the checkout. In cases where two or more items share the same name, even if they have different SKUs, only one of those items is sent to the antifraud system. The transaction amount for the remaining items is sent as freight.


##

## Simulation


Place an order with 2 items in the cart where they share the same name.

## Workaround
