## Summary


Connectors from that list need to save more fields for the connector that works with “Venda direta” - Sales app. Specifically, for the connectors listed below, and only for them, all content from the payload should be directed to the "`connectorResponses`" field. This results in a duplication of the "`tid`" field, which already exists in the "`connectorResponses`." While this duplication does not pose a problem in terms of the transaction life cycle, it does create an inconsistency when generating reports from the order page.

##

## Simulation



1. Access the admin order page.
2. Generate the order report.
3. Look for the `tId` column where the orders were placed using one of these connectors


##

## Workaround


Use the /payment route or the GET order API to retrieve this data
