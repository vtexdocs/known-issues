## Summary


The paymentLink field link is not being displayed on the My Credits page, within MyAccount, even though it has been configured and available on the Invoices page of Customer Credit, within the Admin.


## Simulation



1. Use the Change Invoice endpoint from Developers Portal to configure a `paymentLink` for an existent Invoice of yours
2. Refresh the Invoice page and the link will be available in the `Comments` field
3. Go to store and login
4. go to My Credits page, into My Account
5. The field `comments` will be empty



## Workaround


Even known this is not the best solution, a possible workaround is to send  the `observation` field with the link, using the Change Invoice endpoint. The `observations` field is also added in the `Comments` field but it can be seen inside My Credits page.
