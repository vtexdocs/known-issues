## Summary


Users are unable to access customer credit settings UI on the Admin and we have observed the following "Forbidden" error in the SettingQueries operation.

This behavior is due to the way the customer credit app uses graphQL to retrieve this information. It makes a request to this `/billing/company` route, which uses the admin user's token. This API call is used to display trivial identifying information on the page. Therefore, the user trying to open the CC settings must have the get_company resource enabled in the License Manager Resource.

Although this should not prevent the user from accessing the customer credit settings, therefore, the app must change how it handles this flow.


##

## Simulation


Try to open the Customer Credit settings page with a user without the `get_company` resource in the LM module.


##

## Workaround


Make sure the user has the `get_company` resource enabled in their role. Additionally, there's a cache in this operation.
