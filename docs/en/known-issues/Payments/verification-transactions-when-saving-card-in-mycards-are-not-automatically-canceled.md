## Summary


When a card is saved in the MyCards module, a verification transaction in the amount of R$ 1.50 is generated, which, after following the authorization and approval flow, must be automatically canceled. This transaction is intended to validate that the saved card is authentic and is transacting smoothly.
However, it was identified that in the case where the acquirer returns an undefined in the communication, the Gateway is not calling simulation



## Simulation


This is an intermittent problem and depends on the provider, so we can't determine a step by step to reproduce this scenario



## Workaround


No Workaround was identified but it is possible to manually cancel the R$ 1.50 transaction via API
