## Summary


At times, errors may occur while processing our operations through the gateway. In the case of Firstdata's connector, an error may arise immediately after the settlement approval on our side. To sort out this, we need to request a settlement again. However, due to idempotency, the provider does not send an "approved" response again, which can cause the transaction to become stuck in a "settling" status until a new status update is provided.

## Simulation


It's not possible to reproduce because it's intermittent.


##

## Workaround


There's no workaround available
