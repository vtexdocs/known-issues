## Summary


Callcenter users cannot remove the credit card saved in a shopper profile via My Account. It'll generate a generic 404 exception.



## Simulation



1. Log in as callcenter operator user
2. Impersonate a customer's profile
3. Try to remove the saved credit card



## Workaround


The card can be deleted by the customer/profile owner. For the profile owner, the action will work normally.
