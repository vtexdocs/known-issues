## Summary


Incomplete transactions ("No name" customer) can appear in Transactions section with R$ currency, those are result of creation error (payment data was not sent) but the orders are created correctly in local currency.

As these transactions are already lost there is no operational impact (visual bug).


##

## Simulation


When finishing a payment at checkout you can reload the page to "break" the process and check in UI if the complete transaction creation failed (looking for the "No name" one).


##

## Workaround
