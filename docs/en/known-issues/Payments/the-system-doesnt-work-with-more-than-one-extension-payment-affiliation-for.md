## Summary


The system doesn't work with more than one extension payment affiliation.


## Simulation


Set up two online debit rules using different acquirer affiliation.
Sometimes the transaction isn't created in the correct affiliation.


## Workaround


For now, there are no workarounds.
The client should associate only one affiliation or disable one of those.
