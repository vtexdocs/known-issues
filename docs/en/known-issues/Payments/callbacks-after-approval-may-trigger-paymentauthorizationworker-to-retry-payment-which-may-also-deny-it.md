## Summary


When the provider sends a callback right after authorization, it may trigger a new authorization attempt. Hence, in some cases when the transaction has more than 1 payment and one of them is a gift card, a new authorization retry may cancel the transaction when it has no funds.


##

## Simulation


It can't be simulated as it depends on the provider's callback.


##

## Workaround


N/A
