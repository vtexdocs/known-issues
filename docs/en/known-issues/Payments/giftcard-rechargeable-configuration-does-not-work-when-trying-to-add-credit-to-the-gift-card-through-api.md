## Summary


When creating a Gift card, we configure whether it is rechargeable or not. However, the impediment of adding credit to a non-rechargeable Gift card happens only through the UI, through the API it is possible to add credit even if the Gift Card is not rechargeable.



## Simulation



1. Create a non-rechargeable Gift card
2. Go to admin Gift card page and the UI will not allow the recharge
3. Try to add credit through API and there will be no block to this action



## Workaround


N/A
