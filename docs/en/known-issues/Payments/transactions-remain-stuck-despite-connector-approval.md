## Summary


In some cases, the Transaction Worker fails to advance the transaction to the expected status, even after receiving a successful response (200 OK) from the connector. As a result, transactions may remain stuck in Pending Authorization, Authorized, or Analyzing Risk, and the corresponding orders stay in "Payment Pending". This behavior can occur when the connector correctly returns an approved response, but the internal process that updates the transaction status does not execute properly.


#### Simulation


It is not possible to simulate.


#### Workaround


The workaround depends on the current transaction status:

- Scenario 1 â€“ Transaction stuck in Pending Authorization Execute the following API to manually advance authorization: POST /api/pvt/transactions/{transactionId}/authorization-request ðŸ”— API reference: https://developers.vtex.com/docs/api-reference/payments-gateway-api#post-/api/pvt/transactions/-transactionId-/authorization-request
- Scenario 2 â€“ Transaction stuck in Authorized
- Scenario 3 â€“ Transaction stuck in Analyzing Risk
For scenarios 2 and 3, it is necessary to open a ticket for Product.
