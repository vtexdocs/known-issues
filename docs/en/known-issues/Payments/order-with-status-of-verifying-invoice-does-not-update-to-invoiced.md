## Summary


Due to an inconsistency, there is a difference between what was actually captured and what was requested for capture. Making it impossible to invoice the order.



## Simulation


It is not possible to simulate this problem, but we can see that it exists by checking with the API https://{account}.myvtex.com/api/payments/pvt/transactions/{transactionId}/settlements requests and actions.
If there is a divergence between the total values, then we can confirm the inconsistency




## Workaround


The way we currently solve this is to insert a settlement entry with the value directly into the database, so when we click to invoice at OMS, whoever calls the gateway will understand that the values match, and we no longer need to call no settlement, allowing the order to move
