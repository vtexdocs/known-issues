## Summary


After sending the Capture Request to the NPS connector, we receive their response. However, currently, we do not have any action in place for when the `psp_ResponseCod` field returns a value different from 2. This causes the capture operation to fail, preventing the payment from being captured successfully.


##

## Simulation


It is not possible to simulate the behavior as we depend on the provider's response.

## Workaround
