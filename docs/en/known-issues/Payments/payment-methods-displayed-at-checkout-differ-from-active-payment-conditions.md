## Summary


This KI is manifested in two ways at checkout:

1. Payment Methods **do not** appear on the checkout page, even when the associated payment condition is active for more than 10 min.
2. Payment Methods **remain** on the checkout page even when the associated payment condition is disabled for more than 10 min.

This is an intermittent issue and there is no evidence of how to reproduce this behavior. There is a greater incidence on customized payment methods.


##

## Simulation


N/A


##

## Workaround



1. Resaving the rule.
2. Reindexing all payment systems at checkout via API.
