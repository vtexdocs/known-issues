## Summary


VTEX's payment gateway sends the same pre-analysis request to the anti-fraud provider a second time, even when the first call was successful.

It is not expected for the gateway to send multiple pre-analysis requests, as this can cause the fraud analysis process to take longer than necessary. However, according to our protocol, the anti-fraud provider must be prepared to handle multiple requests.

The duplicated request can be seen in the interactions logs:
`Provider Owner Account is Request HTTP POST to /pre-analysis`
