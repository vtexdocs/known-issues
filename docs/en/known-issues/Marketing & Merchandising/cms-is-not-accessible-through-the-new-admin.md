## Summary

When accessing the CMS through the new administrative environment (My VTEX - `{AccountName}.myvtex.com/admin`), an error page is displayed, and the CMS can not be accessed.

![4JSc1cw](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vtexdocs/known-issues/refs/heads/main/docs/en/known-issues/Marketing%20&%20Merchandising/cms-is-not-accessible-through-the-new-admin_1.png)

## Simulation

- Access any store through the new administrative environment.
- Click the __CMS__ option in the side menu.

## Workaround

We're already taking care of this scenario, but in the meantime you need to access the catalog (which uses the old administrative environment - `vtexcommercestable`), and go from there to the CMS.
