## Summary

After changing a product category or modifying the category tree, some products may have duplicate product or SKU specifications.


## Simulation

__Changing product's category:__

1. Access the catalog.
2. Browse to Products Management > Products and SKUs > Product and SKUs Management.
3. Choose a product and click the __Change__ button.
4. Change the category.
5. Save the product.

__Changing a category's parent category:__

1. Access the catalog.
2. Browse to Products Management > Category.
3. Select a category.
4. Click __ations__ > __change__.
5. Change the parent category.
6. Save.

## Workaround

There are no workarounds at this time, both for the category change in the product and for the parent category change. To solve the problem of product specifications or duplicate SKUs, you can index the product again. In most cases, this action solves the problem.

*__Attention:__ If it's a product specification, it's necessary to access the product page in Admin, make a small change and save it. That way, you will force reindexing. If it's an SKU duplicate specification, you need to follow the same procedure described previously, however accessing the page of the SKU in question.*
