## Summary

When multiple SKUs of the same product have the same combination of specifications and the customer selects one of them on the product page, the message _"Por favor selecione o tamanho desejado"_ (please select a size) pops up, and they canâ€™t proceed to add the product to the shopping cart.

## Simulation

1. Create a product that has more than two SKUs with at least two specifications and two values for each specification.
2. Select the same combination of specification values for each SKU (see an example below).
3. Go to the product page and try to buy the product. 

Example: 

You have the product shirt with four SKUs. It has the specifications **"Size"** and **"Color"**, with the options **"S"**, **"M"** and **"L"** for size and **"Red"** or **"Blue"** for **Color**. 

On the `SkuForm.aspx` page, please select the following specifications:

- **SKU #1:** Size = L and Color = Red
- **SKU #2:** Size = L and Color = Red
- **SKU #3:** Size = M and Color = Red
- **SKU #4:** Size = M and Color = Blue 

If you select either SKU #1 or SKU #2 on the product page, you won't be able to proceed to checkout due to the problem mentioned above.


## Workaround

A possible workaround is to edit the specification values of one of the SKUs that have the same values.
