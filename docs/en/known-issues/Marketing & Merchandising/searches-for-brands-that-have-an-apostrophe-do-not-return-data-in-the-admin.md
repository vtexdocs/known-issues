## Summary

In the Admin's __Brands__ section (`https://{storename}.myvtex.com/admin/Site/ Brand.aspx`), if you search for a brand whose name has an apostrophe ('), it will not be shown in the search results. This happens even if the brand is on the list. Other special characters work correctly.


## Simulation

1. Create a brand whose name contains an apostrophe;
2. Use the Admin search to search for the newly created brand.

## Workaround

We recommend using GET by [Brand API](https://developers.vtex.com/reference/category-and-brand#brand), using the brand ID for the search.
