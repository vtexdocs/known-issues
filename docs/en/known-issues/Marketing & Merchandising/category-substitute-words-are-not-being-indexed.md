## Summary

The category substitute words are not being indexed, so using them in the search does not bring products within the corresponding category.

## Simulation

1. Enter a substitute word for a given category.
2. Make sure that your products are indexed after the update.
3. Search for products using that substitute word in the store.

## Workaround

Register the substitute words directly in the products of the category. Or, if it's the case, create a [redirect 301](/en/faq/what-is-url-mapping-301-redirect) of this substitute word for the category that should be returned.
