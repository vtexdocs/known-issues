## Summary

When changing the weight of SKUs that comprise a bundle, the Net Weight field do not automatically update.

## Simulation

1. Access the bundle creation page
2. Change the net weight and/or shipping weight of the SKUs that the bundle comprises of
3. Check and confirm that none of the bundle fields were changed


## Workaround

The solution is manually updating the bundle after any changes to its SKUs.
