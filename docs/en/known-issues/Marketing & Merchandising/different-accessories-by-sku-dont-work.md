## Summary

When setting up different accessories for one SKU, they are not displayed on the store product page when a specific SKU is selected.


## Simulation

1. Enter the catalog.
2. Navigate to Products Management > Products and SKUs > Products and SKUs Management.
3. Choose a product with more than one SKU.
4. Edit each SKU and select different accessories in each.
5. View the product in the store (on the front-end) and switch between SKUs.

## Workaround

There is no workaround available. Although the catalog allows for registration of different accessories by SKU, access to this information is only possible at the product level. Therefore, what comes into effect are the accessories configured in the first SKU.
