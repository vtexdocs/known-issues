## Summary

When the product page loads, the system considers the main SKU to render the complementary shelves (Accessories, Suggestion, Similar, Show together).

However, when the user selects another SKU (through the SKU selection control), these shelves are not updated to the new context (the new SKU's one).

## Simulation

1. Edit the SKUs by entering different values between them in the Accessories, Suggestion, Similar and/or Show Together shelves;
2. Enter the product page;
3. Change between product SKUs and note that the shelves will not change the displayed values.

## Workaround

Currently there is no workaround for this scenario.
