## Summary

The $product.InsertSku aisle template control is rendering SKUs (variations) by ID and not by their admin configured position.

## Simulation

In order to reproduce this behaviour:
1. Configure a product with SKU variation
2. On the SKU management screen, order the SKUs in such a way that the SKU with a lower ID comes after an SKU with a higher ID
3. Configure the aisle template using the $product.InsertSku control
4. Use this aisle template in some aisle or product shelf
5. Access this aisle or product shelf, as seen by the customer

You'll notice that the SKUs are ordered by ID and not according to the set positioning. 

## Workaround

The workaround for this type of behavior is to ensure that SKU IDs are equivalent to their position within the product.

Ex.: A product has the following SKUs: S, M, L. The "S" SKU needs to have the lowest ID, followed "M" and the highest ID "G" thereafter.
