## Summary

When creating a new dictionary in the CMS module, if it does not have any previously registered Hosts, the "Add" button is blocked by default.

For this button to become utilizable, you need to click on the search button (magnifying glass) and then on the "Clear" button.


## Simulation

Create a new dictionary in the CMS Module that has no previously registered Host.

## Workaround

In the CMS module, click on the magnifying glass and then on the "Clear" button to unlock the "Add" new host button.
