## Summary

The Welcome Message control (`<vtex.cmc: welcomeMessage/>`) is responsible for rendering the HTML snippet that displays the welcome message to the user as well as the login link.

When copying a Web Site Binding, we realize that this control does not appear in the template that is used in more than one Web Site. For example, in the Home template.

## Simulation

- Enter the CMS module
- Click on the Web Sites folder
- Click on the Web Site
- Click on the option "Copy Web Site"
- Set it as you want (Web Site name, links, etc.)
- Save Web Site
- In the Home template, use the same template used by the other Web Site
- Save the layout
- Access the template

## Workaround

As a workaround, we recommend that a prefix or suffix is used in the template name to identify the deletion intention.

Example: 
From `Home` to` Trash-Home`
