## Summary

When the user tries to review a product, a window on the same page opens requesting login. However, if the user doesn't want to log in, they cannot leave the window. There is not a button to close this window.

However, if the user is already logged in before clicking to review the product, there is a button to close this window.

## Simulation

- Login without signing in;
- Go to any product page;
- Click on the option to review the product;
- Try to leave the window.

## Workaround

The solution is to click the "Back" button on the browser to go back to the product page.
