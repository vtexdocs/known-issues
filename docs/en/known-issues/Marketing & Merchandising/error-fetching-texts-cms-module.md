## Summary

We detect an unexpected behavior when trying to perform the change/translation of a text in the Settings - Store text area. This behavior leads to an error when searching the word to be changed or translated. In some cases it doesn't generate the error and does not return the result.

## Simulation

1. Access CMS -> Settings -> Store texts.
2. Search for the word "range".
3. When searching, the system sometimes doesn't filter precisely the pages that contain this word. Other times, it leads to an error.

## Workaround

Put the word in the search field, then choose the variable you want to change. Example: "FaixaPreco". The system will bring the word in the result field.
