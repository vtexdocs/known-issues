## Summary

Presently, this functionality can lead to inconsistencies in your category treeâ€™s databank, depending on the movement type. This functionality is therefore not recommended until it can be remedied.

The following inconsistencies were identified as a result of this problem:
- Duplicated product specifications/SKUs
- Category and subcategory are not inheriting department specifications
- Side filter ordering is incorrect


## Simulation



## Workaround

 1. Disable the current category you wish to move
 2. Create a new category in the desired location
 3. Move the products to the newly created category
