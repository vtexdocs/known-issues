## Summary

The voucher export (/admin/Site/Vale.aspx) today doesn't use asynchronous processing (with file sent by email) and this ends up causing large exports to return error to the user.

## Simulation

1. In admin, access the Catalog module.
2. Browse through the menu Control of Campaigns > Vouchers.
3. To export a large number of vouchers (more than 1000, approximately).


## Workaround

- __Option 1__: In the list itself apply filters (for data/status), reducing the number of registers.
- __Option 2__: Redeem the vouchers through API.
