## Summary

Pricing is not considering a promotion with discount when we create a tax rate using the formula which sees the total Value of the order.

AN example of how this looks like:
Tax rate configured as ((total + shipping) * 0.1)

|||
|-|-|
|Subtotal|100,00|
|Discount|10,00|
|Shipping|20,00|
|__Tax__|__12,00__|
|Total|122,00|

An example of how it's supposed to look like:
Tax rate configured as ((total + shipping) * 0.1)

|||
|-|-|
|Subtotal|100,00|
|Discount|10,00|
|Shipping|20,00|
|__Tax__|__11,00__|
|Total|121,00|

The example showing how it should look like shows that the Tax rate formula calculated the total value by taking into account the $10 discount.

## Simulation

Create any promotion and a tax rate following the formula ((total + shipping) * 0.1).
Simulate a product in the cart with this promotion and tax rate.
The value of the tax will be calculated based on the total value, without taking the discount into account.

## Workaround

There is no workaround.
