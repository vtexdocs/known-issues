## Summary

>⚠️ **Warning**: VTEX has two search options - VTEX search and VTEX Intelligent Search. This article refers to the VTEX search. To learn more about the VTEX Intelligent Search application, see <a href = "https://help.vtex.com/tracks/vtex-intelligent-search--19wrbB7nEQcmwzDPl1l4Cb">this track</a>.

Second-level folders are not considering the "search context" that was registered for it. The _slug_ of the URL's second level is acting as a filter of the first folder (based on its context).

## Simulation

1. In the CMS, create a folder in the root of the website and set a search context for it;
2. Create a second folder inside the one previously created, with a different search context;
3. Access this second folder on the website and note that its content does not match what is expected.

Practical example:

- `/special-promotion` folder that has collection 111 as search context;
- `/some-products` folder registered inside the previous folder with collection 222 as search context.

The second folder can be accessed at www.site.com/special-promotion/some-products, but it will not bring the products in the 222 collection. Instead, it will bring a search for the term "some products" within collection 111 (from first folder).

## Workaround

In cases where the search context is relevant to the scenario, you should only work with top-level folders.
