## Summary

"Store texts" search shows many results that have nothing to do with the term that was searched.

## Simulation

1. Access the CMS module -> Settings tab -> Store Texts
2. Type in a word in the search field that is generated by the platform. EX: "buy" -> from the text written on the buy button
3. Click on search
4. Multiple results that have nothing to do with the search come up

## Workaround

1. In the CMS module, click on Settings and on the General tab, you'll find a box called "XML text"
2. Select the entire text inside that box with crtl+a and copy it to a text editor.
3. Search for the same word in that text editor
4. In CMS -> Settings -> Store Texts, look for the Combobox and find the variable belonging to the word you searched for.
