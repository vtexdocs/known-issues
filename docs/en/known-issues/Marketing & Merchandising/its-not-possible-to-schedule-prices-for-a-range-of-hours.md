## Summary

It is not possible to schedule hourly rates through admin.

You can schedule an hour through the API or through worksheet, but:
1. The hours are not exported in the price worksheet;
2. The hours are not displayed in the price management interface.

## Simulation

1. Enter the admin price module.
2. Click on "Edit" a price.
3. Schedule the expiration date of the price.
4. In the start/end date selection, you can not choose start/end time.

## Workaround

This scenario occurs in all cases when modifying a price through the admin.

Alternatively, you can schedule hourly prices through a pricing worksheet or through API.
