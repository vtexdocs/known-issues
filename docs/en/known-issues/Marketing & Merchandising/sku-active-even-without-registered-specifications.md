## Summary

When importing the Products/SKUs spreadsheet, SKUs with the ___AtivarSkuSePossível___ column filled with __"SIM"__ and that have no registered specifications are being activated in the store.


## Simulation

1. Access the catalog.
2. Navigate to Product Registration > Products and SKUs > Import/Export Products and SKUs.
3. Export spreadsheet with products that don't have registered specifications.
4. Change in each row of the worksheet the column ___AtivarSkuSePossível___ to __SIM__.
5. Import the products and SKUs spreadsheet.

## Workaround

When importing the spreadsheet, make sure that the __AtivarSkuSePossível__ column is marked as __NÃO__ for the SKUs that should remain inactive.
