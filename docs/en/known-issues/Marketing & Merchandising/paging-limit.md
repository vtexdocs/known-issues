## Summary

The products returned, whether in a collection, category, department or search, have a limit of 50 pages.

## Simulation

1. Create a collection that exceeds the number of 50 pages. (for example, set it to show 4 columns with 20 products on each page in the CMS template.)
2. Create a collection with more than 1000 products and set it to appear in the respective configuration.

## Workaround

1. Create a collection with fewer products.
2. Break up the collection.
3. Set it to show more products per page (__be careful__, this may cause the page to take longer to load).
