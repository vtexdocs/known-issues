## Summary

The CMS **Search Context** field does not work properly on the search result if filtering by `productId` or `skuId`.

## Simulation

1. On Admin, click on the **CMS** module.
2. Click on **Layout**.
3. Click on the **CMS** directory.
4. Click on the **Sites and channels** folder.
5. Click on the desired website.
6. Click on the **Busca** folder.
7. Click on the `New folder` button.
8. Add a value to the **Search Context (Default)** field.
9. Fill the remaining fields.
10. Click on `Save Folder`.

After doing this setup, you can simulate it by doing a query on the Portal filtering by a `productId` or `skuId`, for example:

`https://{accountName}.{environment}.com.br/busca/?fq=productId:30`

The search result will return lots of products, but not what was filtered by the query.

## Workaround

Remove the **Search Context** from the folder.
