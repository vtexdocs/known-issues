## Summary

When accessing the group configuration for the main category (ID 0) it's not possible to sort the groups registered in this category.

## Simulation

1. From the side menu, click **Catalog**.
2. Click **Categories**.
3. Click the category named **Categories**, that is, the first parent category.
4. Access **Actions** > **Group**.
5. On the next page you can view the groups, but the blue bars used to sort the groups are not displayed.

## Workaround

Currently the only solution is to perform the ordering of the fields through a Javascript customization on the front-end.
