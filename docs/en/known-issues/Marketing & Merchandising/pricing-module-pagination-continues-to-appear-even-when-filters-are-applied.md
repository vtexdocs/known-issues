## Summary

The pricing module's pagination control keeps displaying the original pagination, even when a filter is applied that should theoretically keep pagination to a single page. This problem is only visual and does not affect pagination when more data needs to be displayed on subsequent pages.

## Simulation

Filter by a product in the Pricing module and try to change the pagination.

## Workaround
