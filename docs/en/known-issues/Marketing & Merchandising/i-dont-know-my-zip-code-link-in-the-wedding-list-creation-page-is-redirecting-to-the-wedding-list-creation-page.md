## Summary

The link "I don't know my ZIP code" doesn't work in the wedding list creation page. It redirects the user to the wedding list creation page itself. The used template control is `<vtex.cmc:GiftListFormV2/>`.

## Simulation

1. Navigate to the store's wedding list creation page;
2. Click in the link "I don't know my ZIP code".


## Workaround

There is no workaround.
