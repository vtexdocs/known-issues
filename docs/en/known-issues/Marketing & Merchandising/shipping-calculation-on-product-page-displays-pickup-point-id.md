## Summary

If the store has a registered pickup point, the shipping simulation on the *product page* will display the pickup point ID used for identification in the logistics module.

## Simulation

1. Register a pickup point in the Logistics module and associate a product to be withdrawn at this point;
2. Access the URL of the page for this product;
3. Simulate the shipping;
4. Next to the name of the pickup point will appear a value in parentheses. This value is the pickup point ID used for identification in the Logistics module.

## Workaround

The store needs to adjust the front-end so it doesn't display the value in parentheses.
