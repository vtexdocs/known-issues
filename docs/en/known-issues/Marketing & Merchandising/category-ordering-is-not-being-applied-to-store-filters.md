## Summary

The ordering of categories in the Admin is not reflected on the store front when using native VTEX navigation controls.


## Simulation

1. From the side menu, click Catalog.
2. Click Categories.
3. Click a department that has categories or a category with subcategories.
4. Access Actions > Change.
5. In the child ategory section, set the ordering you want.
6. Click Save.

## Workaround

Currently the only solution is to perform the ordering of the categories through a customization with Javascript on the front end.
