## Summary

When updating more than twice the value of the same UTM, this value is not stored in the cookie and is not relevant to the purchase.

## Simulation

1. Access an environment with utm_source=1. The cookie IPS will be updated to parceiro=1.
2. Then, access the environment with utm_source=2. The cookie will be updated to parceiro=2.
3. Then, if you login with utm_source=3, the cookie will remain as parceiro=2, but with updated validity.

## Workaround

There is currently no workaround for this scenario.
