## Summary

The values registered in the Title and Alt of the SKUs' secondary images are being replaced by the values of the main image.

## Simulation

1. Edit an SKU;
2. Register more than one image for the SKU with distinct values in the __label__ and __text__ fields;
3. On the product page, note that the values printed in the HTML of the secondary image(s) are the same as the one in the first image.

## Workaround

There is no workaround for this scenario.
