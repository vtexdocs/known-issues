## Summary

The VTEX XML service renders the price tags in the format `$ 99999,99`, with a comma as decimal separator.

Recently, Google Shopping stopped accepting the comma as a separator, being necessary to send it as a dot.

## Simulation

1. From the admin menu, access the Catalog.
2. From the Catalog menu, enter Settings > XML.
3. Access an XML file that is compatible with Google Shopping.
4. Search for one of the `<g:price>` tags.

## Workaround

Not being a format available in XML, the current solution is to use the API integration with Google Shopping, which is available as a native marketplace integration in VTEX.
