## Summary

When you have shared categories and brands between the Ecommerce and the Sellers, it becomes essential to be able to carry out more advanced filters in the Export and Import SKUs/Products spreadsheet in order to correctly handle catalog management.

At present, it is not possible to filter the spreadsheet by Seller, since the Name or ID of the Seller is not present. It can be filtered by brand, category or store, but it would be missing the seller.

## Simulation

1. Access the __Catalog__ menu.
2. Access the __Product Registration > Products and SKU > Import/Export SKUs and Products__.
3. Export to excel. Upon opening the excel document, you'll find it obvious that there is no relation between the products and the associated sellers.

## Workaround

Have another spreadsheet which maintains Seller-SKU relationships and filter accordingly using excel functions.
