## Summary

Google recently increased the Meta Tag Description limit to 320 characters. However, VTEX's own system already follows Google's former default and limits the number of characters, making it impossible to use longer descriptions.

## Simulation

- Create a Meta Tag Description (in the product registry) with more than 150 characters
- Search for the product on Google
- Identify the shortened description within the search results 

## Workaround

For now, the solution is using Meta Tag Description of 150 characters or less, otherwise it will be cut in Google search results.
