## Summary

In the Catalog module, when you use a single quotation mark (or other characters) to apply a filter to a text field, the system may return an error. Since the system memorizes the last filter applied by the user, refreshing the page will not resolve the problem.

## Simulation

__Important__: Since this problem is irreversible, do not try to reproduce it.

1. In admin, access the Catalog module.
2. In the E-Commerce module, access, for example, the products and SKUs page (Product Register > Products and SKUs > Products and SKUs Register).
3. In the "Product Name" filter, look for a word containing a single quotation mark.


## Workaround

Open a ticket with your service partner, giving the email address of the user facing this problem.
