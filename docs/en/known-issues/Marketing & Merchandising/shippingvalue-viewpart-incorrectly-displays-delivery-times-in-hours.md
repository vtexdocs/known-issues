## Summary

The `<vtex.cmc:shippingValue/>` ViewPart, which can be used on the product page to calculate the shipping value and delivery times, incorrectly displays the hours and minutes of such deadlines. 

For example: a carrier called "Express", having a delivery time of up to 4 hours, will display the following text:

`Express Shipping, delivery to ZIP code XX in up to 4 days.` 

## Simulation


- Access any product page that uses this ViewPart.
- Have a product whose delivery time is calculated in minutes or hours
- Calculate the delivery time using this component
- Check the result

## Workaround

__This component must be considered obsolete.__

At present, we recommend manually calculating shipping and delivery using Checkout's cart simulation API.

In addition, you may also use this API through the ["vtex.js" Javascript library](https://github.com/vtex/vtex.js/tree/master/docs/checkout#simulateshippingitems-postalcode-country-saleschannel-deprecated).
