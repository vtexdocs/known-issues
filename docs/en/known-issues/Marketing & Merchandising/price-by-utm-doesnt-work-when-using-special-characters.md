## Summary

The possibility of creating different prices is a feature widely used in VTEX. It's a great resource for practicing different values according to your store's business partner, such as associating a value of a product to be displayed in Buscapé.

Standard price: 549,00
Price UTM Buscapé: 449,00

However, when using special characters at the time of registering the **utm\_campaign**, the platform does not recognize the term and the value is not applied.

## Simulation

1. Create a new entry in the Values Table
2. Associate the new value with a UTM and in the value of **utm\_campaign** use a special character, for example: `bp+`
3. Save

## Workaround

Just remove any special characters from the UTM field
