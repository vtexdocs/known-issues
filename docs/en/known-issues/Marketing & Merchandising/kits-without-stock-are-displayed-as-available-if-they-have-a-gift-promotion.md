## Summary

Kits applicable to gift promotions, but that are out of stock, are incorrectly displayed as available on the shelves and product pages.

Despite this, they are correctly indexed as unavailable, and it's not possible to continue with the purchase after reaching the cart, which will show that the products are unavailable.

## Simulation

- Register a kit that has one or more components without stock.
- Create a gift promotion for this kit.
- Observe its behavior on the product page.

## Workaround

One way to avoid this scenario is to choose not to display the products which are out of stock, according to the product registration. Because they are indexed correctly, by not showing the item availability, it will be inaccessible.
