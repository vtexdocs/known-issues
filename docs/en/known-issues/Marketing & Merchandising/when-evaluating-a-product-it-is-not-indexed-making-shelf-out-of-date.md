When reviewing a product through the UserReview control, it is not put back again in the indexing queue, thus not being updated on the shelves. Because of that, in the momento of voting, the shelf becomes oudated until the next indexig event. 

## Simulation

- Vote a product;
- Do not reindex it.

## Workaround

Reindex the product.
