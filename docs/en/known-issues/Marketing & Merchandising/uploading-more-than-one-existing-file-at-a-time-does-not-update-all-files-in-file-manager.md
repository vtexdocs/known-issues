## Summary

When you upload two or more existing files to File Manager simultaneously, only the first file is updated.

## Simulation

1. In the Admin, click on the **CMS** module.
2. Click **Layout**.
3. Click on the **CMS** folder.
4. Click on the **Files Manager** folder.
5. Click on one of the **Files Manager**’s folders.
6. Click on the `Add` button and select two or more files with the same name of existing files.
7. Click `Save File`. 

After saving, the following message will be displayed:

![File manager](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vtexdocs/help-center-content/refs/heads/main/docs/en/known-issues/Marketing%20&%20Merchandising/uploading-more-than-one-existing-file-at-a-time-does-not-update-all-files-in-file-manager_1.png)

This means that only one file was identified; the others are not being validated. All files are uploaded, but only one will replace its previous version.

## Workaround

A possible workaround is to update one file at a time.
