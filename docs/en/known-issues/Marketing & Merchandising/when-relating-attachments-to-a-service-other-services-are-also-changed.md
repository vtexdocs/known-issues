## Summary

When you relate one or more attachments to a service type, the relationship of attachments with other service types may also be changed.

## Simulation

To simulate the scenario, follow the steps below:

1. Create two or more attachments ([Registering an attachment](/en/tutorial/registering-an-attachment));
2. Create two or more service types ([How to create a service for an SKU](/en/tutorial/creating-a-service-for-a-sku));
3. Link the attachments to a service type. Then create different relationships for another type of service.

When you save a relationship, you will notice that other relationships can be impacted.

## Workaround

Currently there is no workaround for this scenario. If necessary, open a ticket indicating which relationships need to be applied.
