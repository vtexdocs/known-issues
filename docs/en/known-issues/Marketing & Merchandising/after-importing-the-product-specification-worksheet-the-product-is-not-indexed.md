## Summary

After importing a product specification worksheet, the product doesn't enter the indexing queue. This causes the filters to be wrongly displayed in the store.

## Simulation

1. First review the date and time the product was last updated.
2. Import the product specification sheet and wait for the system to give a positive response.
3. Go back to the product list and note that the update date and time have not been changed.

## Workaround

To solve this problem you must manually index the products or reindex the entire store, in case of many products.
