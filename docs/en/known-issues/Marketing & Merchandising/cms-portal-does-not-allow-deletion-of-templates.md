## Summary

After creating a new template, there is no delete functionality, or even other templates. This creates a visual pollution that impairs the maintenance of the CMS as well as increases the risk of human error.

## Simulation

1. In the admin, access the CMS module;
2. In the side menu, navigate to Portal > Page Templates;
3. When clicking on Page Templates, the system will list, in the right frame, all available templates;
4. Try to delete a template.

## Workaround

Currently there is no workaround for this issue.
