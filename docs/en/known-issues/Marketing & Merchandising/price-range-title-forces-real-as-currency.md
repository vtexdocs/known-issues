## Summary

One of the search result filters is the price range. Applying this filter, you can see that the title tag is changed to the selected range. However, the currency entered in the title is always the Real ("R$").

## Simulation

1. Filter it by price range;
2. Note the page title.

## Workaround

The workaround is to change the title tag using JavaScript.
