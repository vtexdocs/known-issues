## Summary

When you upload the spreadsheet to import product images, all or some of the lines point to errors. However, even with these errors, when receiving the email with the import report you find that some items were actually imported.


## Simulation

1. Create a spreadsheet for importing images based on the specifications in the article [Importing images via a worksheet](/en/tutorial/importing-images-via-a-worksheet).
2. Access the catalog.
3. From the menu choose Products Management > Products and SKUs > Import Images.
4. Click the __Select File__ button.
5. Navigate and select the spreadsheet to upload.
6. Click on the __import__ button.

## Workaround

There is no workaround for importing images through spreadsheet. An alternative way to import images is to use webservice.
