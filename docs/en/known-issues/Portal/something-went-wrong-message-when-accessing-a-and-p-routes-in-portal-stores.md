## Summary


It is expected to search for any term in the Portal's stores; however, the letters "A" and "P" are not directly searchable via the URL.
So, a "Something went wrong" message will appear when accessing `/a` and `/p` routes in Portal stores


##

## Simulation



1. Go to a portal store
2. Go to the link `site.com/a` or `site.com/p`
3. See a "Something went wrong" on the front


##

## Workaround


N/A to `/a` path
Register a redirect in the legacy CMS from `/p` to `/?ft=p`
