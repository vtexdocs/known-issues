## Summary


When searching for any term without clicking enter, the autocomplete brings results of products that contain that term.

The wrong scenario here happens when this term is changed multiple times without clicking enter. Eventually the autocomplete stops bringing results.


##

## Simulation



1. On an account using Portal Search try to search for a term without clicking enter;
2. Change this term and check that the autocomplete options also change;
3. Now continue to change multiple times, eventually no suggestions will appear on the autocomplete.


##

## Workaround


There is no workaround
