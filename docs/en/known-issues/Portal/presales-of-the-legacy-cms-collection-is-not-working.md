## Summary


It was expected that, by selecting the pre-order checkbox, the collection would be populated with products whose release date had been filled in for a future date.
However, this is not happening, as the collection is not populated, but always remains empty.


##

## Simulation



- Set a release date on some products for a future date
- Create a collection
- Go to the collection admin in the legacy CMS
- Configure the collection for pre-sale products
- See that the collection is never populated


##

## Workaround


Manually manage the products in the collection
