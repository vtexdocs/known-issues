## Summary



On Portal legacy stores, the auto-complete search does not work if the search terms have space.



## Simulation



- Go to the search bar and try to search for "super product", for example.
- The request will fail.

Although the auto-complete search does not work, the default search will work properly.



## Workaround


The workaround for this case is to use a javascript customization to make the autocomplete search work properly (using %20 instead of +)
