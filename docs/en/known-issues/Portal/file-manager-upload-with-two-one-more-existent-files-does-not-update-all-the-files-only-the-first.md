## Summary


File Manager upload with two one more existent files does not update all the files, only the first


##

## Simulation


- Go to /admin/a, file manager, and add 2 or more files to upload;
- Now upload two other files with the same name:
- We will receive a warning telling usthat the file exists, asking us if we want to replace it.

This warning is telling us only about one file, the second one is not being validated.

- Both files upload, but only one will replace the older one.


##

## Workaround


Update one file per time.
