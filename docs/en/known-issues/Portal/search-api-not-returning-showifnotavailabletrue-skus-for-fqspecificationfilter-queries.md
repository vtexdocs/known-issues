## Summary



Our search routes should display information about products tagged as showIfNotAvailable=true.

However, when using sku specification queries, as `&fq=specificationFilter_:` for a given SKU that has this specification, that is not available but still showing on the storefront, the response on the API will be empty, which diverges from the standard behavior of the rest of the API queries for the /search/



## Simulation


1) Create a sku that has a sku specification.
2) Make it unavailable but still showing on the store
3) Try searching using the `&fq=specificationFilter_:` query on a /search/ API.
4) Nothing will be retuned (the SKU you've just configured should be!)



## Workaround


Using the specifications as product specifications and/or using other search parameters to find skus.
