## Summary


Currently, when you enter a value in the Unit of Mass field in the CMS settings, the system does not allow the value to be removed by UI



## Simulation


- Go to the cms settings page `/admin/Site/ConfigForm.aspx`
- Fill in the value in the Mass unit field and save
- Try to remove the value and save again
- Notice that the value will remain



## Workaround


At the product level, we are able to change the value. Therefore, it is necessary for the customer to open a ticket to request the change.
