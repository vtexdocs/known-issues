## Summary


Percentage shipping, maximum shipping, free shipping, and gift promotions are not generating highlight / flags at PDPs and PLPs.



## Simulation


- Create a Shipping Promotion and set "Promotion is Highlight" to Yes;
- Make sure you are not using any restriction in the cart (zip code range, cluster of costumers etc, for more information https://help.vtex.com/tutorial/configuring-promotions-with-a-highlightflag--tutorials_2295);
- Make sure you are using the correct ViewPart to render this information on the front, for Portal stores: https://help.vtex.com/tutorial/lista-de-controles-para-templates?locale=pt, for IO Stores: https://developers.vtex.com/vtex-developer-docs/docs/vtex-product-highlights
- Check the PDP or PLP, the highlight information will not be available.



## Workaround


There is no workaround.
