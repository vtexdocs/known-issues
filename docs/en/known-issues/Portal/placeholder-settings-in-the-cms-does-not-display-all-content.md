## Summary


Currently, when adding too much content within a placeholder in a CMS layout, Admin does not allow page scrolling, which stops editing



## Simulation



- Go to CMS > Sites and Channels > select a Website > select a Folder > select a Layout > Settings > select a Placeholder > add content
- In case the placeholder has several contents, it will not be possible to see all of them



## Workaround


Access CMS by vtexcommercestable `accountname.vtexcommercestable.com.br/admin/a/`
