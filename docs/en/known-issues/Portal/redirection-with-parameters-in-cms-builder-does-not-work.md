## Summary


Currently, redirection using parameters generates an error despite the URL Bilder admin saying that it is possible to use parameters.



## Simulation




- Register a redirect as instructed by the admin
- Go to the **FROM URL** link
- See that an SWW error is generated on the screen



## Workaround


There is no workaround
