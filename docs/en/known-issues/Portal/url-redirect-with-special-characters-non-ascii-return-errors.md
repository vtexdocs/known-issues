## Summary


If we create a redirect with some special characters, for example `/televisão`, it will not work, we will receive the following error:

    Link: account.vtexcommercestable.com.br/televisão Error: The upstream server response returned invalid header characters



##

## Simulation


- Create a redirect 301 on the CMS, for example from `/` to `/televisão`
- Check the response body;


##

## Workaround


Don't use special characters on redirect.
