## Summary


Sometimes promotion flags and discounts are displayed on PLP and PLP after the promotion's expiration date. This happens because the promotion doesn't trigger the product indexation, resulting in the wrong exhibition of the discount.


##

## Simulation


1- Create a promotion with a flag
2- Set an expiration date
3- Check that the promotion continues to be active on PLP and PDP



##

## Workaround


Reindex the products included in the promotion
