## Summary


Value of the "spotPrice" (spot price) in the "skuJson" of the Portal incorrect in products with multiple sellers.

In the installmentOptions of checkout and Search API will be correct, and spotPrice value of richSnippets and skuPrice viewparts (printed in HTML) as well. But skuJson seems to be stuck with seller 1.







## Simulation


- have a product/sku sold by several sellers in addition to the marketplace itself.

- have setup the "paymentSystemId" in skuPrice and/or richSnippets viewparts.

- observe the information returned by the Portal application.







## Workaround



There is no workaround for skuJson specifically.

The other information on the page should be used.
