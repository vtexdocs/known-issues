## Summary


In the PUT Seller API, the property CategoryCommissionPercentage accepts any kind of input, for example, text inputs. This can even break the indexing process for products that have SKUs in which this seller is included.



## Simulation


- In the path `/api/catalog_system/pvt/seller/{{id}}`, try updating the CategoryComissionPercentage property value to anything other than a floating-point, for example any kind of text;
- Check that the SKUs which this seller is included will not index anymore.



## Workaround


Don't use other kinds of value rather than floating-point
