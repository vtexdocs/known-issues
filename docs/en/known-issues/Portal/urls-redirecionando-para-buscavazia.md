## Summary


Some URL's are redirecting to an EmptySearch response.

There are scenarios where when we perform a search on the platform, this does not bring the result through a FullText search. This scenario likely occurs after moving category trees.






##

## Simulation


This is a tough scenario to reproduce, moving several categories over the store's category tree and then trying to, on the storefront, access the pages, will often lead to this empty search response.






##

## Workaround


Registering a redirect on the platform for a similar term and thus not displaying the empty search result.
