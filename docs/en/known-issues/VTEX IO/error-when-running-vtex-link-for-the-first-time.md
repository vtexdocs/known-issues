## Summary

When running `vtex-link` for the first time the user experiences the following error message: `User xxxx@xxxx.com is not authorized for builder "node"`

Although every developer can create stores using Store-Framework, the Node + GraphQL and Extensibility apps require special permissions.  From now on, accounts wanting to be part of the whitelist in order to extend their apps with Node + GraphQL and Extensibility functionalities need to be _enterprise_.

The error authorization message can change from `node`to `react` according to the chosen option.

## Simulation

1.  Install the VTEX CLI (Toolbelt)
2.  Navigate towards the app's directory
3.  Execute the "vtex-link" command through the terminal.

## Workaround

1. Fill out this [form](https://suportevtex1.typeform.com/to/SxXknn) 
2. Access your Account Management module and make sure that your profile has VTEX IO Admin permissions.

>ℹ️ Filling out the form does not guarantee Node + GraphQL and Extensibility Whitelist access.
