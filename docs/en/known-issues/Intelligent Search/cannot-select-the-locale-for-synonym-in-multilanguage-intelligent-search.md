## Summary


For multilanguage stores, Intelligent Search allows you to select the locale or set it to apply to all locales when creating/editing synonyms.

But, when the store is configured for 2 (two) locales, the form of creating/editing a synonym gets stuck and allows only the option `All`, that means the synonym will be applied to all locales.


#### Simulation


The steps to simulate the Know Issue are:

- Open the form to create or edit a synonym.
- In the _Locale_ field, select any option other than **All**.

**Expected result:** The _Locale_ field changes to the selected option.
**Actual result:** The _Locale_ field does not change to the selected option.


#### Workaround
