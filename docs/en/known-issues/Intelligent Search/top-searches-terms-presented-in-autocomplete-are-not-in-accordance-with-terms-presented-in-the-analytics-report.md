## Summary


Data presented in the Intelligent Search Analytics reports, related to terms resulting from autocompletion, do not agree with the Top searches terms presented in autocomplete that are being shown to the user when using the search bar at the front of the store. According to the purpose of the module, the last 10 terms presented in the autocomplete should be the same as the terms presented in the Analytics report, when selecting the Autocomplete option.
