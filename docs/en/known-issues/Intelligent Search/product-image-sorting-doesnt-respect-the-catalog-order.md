## Summary


When you use the prop to show a different image when hovering on a product summary component currently it calls the Intelligent Search API to return the images and with this data it will display a different image when hovering, what happens today is that the order on the Catalog isn't necessary the same order that the search will return causing divergences within the results expected.
