## Summary


It's expected that searched terms are normalized between their different forms (plural/singular, gender, and other possibilities), a process formally called stemming. The analyzer is different for each language to match their needs.

The analyzer for Portuguese is not normalizing the gender of words.


##

## Simulation


Consider a word registered in different products with different genders, such as "camiseta listrada" and "vestido listrado".

Although "listrada" and "listrado" are the same word but in different gender forms, searching "listrada" won't return the "vestidos" â€“ and vice-versa.


##

## Workaround


Register bidirectional synonyms for words with relevant gender form variations.
