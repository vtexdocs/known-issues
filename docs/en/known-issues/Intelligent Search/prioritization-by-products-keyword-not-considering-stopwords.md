## Summary


Products may be prioritized in the search results by their "keyword", a word from the product's name set as relevant by an algorithm. Stopwords are search terms filtered out from the original terms because it's not significant for the search.

In a scenario where the keyword for a product is a stopword, this product may lose priority in the search results.


##

## Simulation



- A product with the name "La vida en el oceano" will have "la" as keyword.
- Considering a Spanish store, a search for this product name will be effectively made as "vida el oceano" after removing the stopwords.
- Products with "vida" as a keyword will be prioritized over the searched product.
