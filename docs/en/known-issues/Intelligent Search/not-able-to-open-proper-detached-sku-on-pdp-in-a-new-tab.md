## Summary


When using detach feature to split products by some SKU specification and trying to open a new tab from PLP to PDP, it doesn't recognize the property parameter being passed to the URL to select the correct SKU, it just displays the proper SKU when opening in the same tab.


##

## Simulation


For that, you will need to have a store using detach feature from the intelligent Search modulehttps://help.vtex.com/pt/tracks/vtex-intelligent-search--19wrbB7nEQcmwzDPl1l4Cb/5uVxuWxTA8VvLX3G8UCcUE

- Go to any PLP page
- For the visual effect, you must select any detached SKU that is not the default SKU from PDP and open it in a new tab
- You will notice that the SKU that you selected is not the same SKU being displayed
