## Summary


At the component "search-bar" with "autocomplete-result-list.v2", hovering the search suggestions will also change the suggested products as well as the text from the "see all {n} products" to mention the selected search, but the hyperlink from "see all" follows the original search term instead of the selected.


##

## Simulation



- search for a partial term
- hover the mouse over suggested terms
- click on "see all products"
