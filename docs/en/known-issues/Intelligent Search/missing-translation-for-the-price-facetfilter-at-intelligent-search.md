## Summary


The Intelligent Search does not apply the translation to the filter/facet name "price" for additional languages when queried via REST API.

The primary language still returns the expected string as its internal configuration, but any other language will return this with "Price" as a fixed value.


##

## Simulation


In a store with multiple languages, set the translations for Intelligent Search context via the messages service to the secondary languages and query it using the facets API. Values for "Price" won't be considered, while it works for any other label, like the categories and brand.


##

## Workaround
