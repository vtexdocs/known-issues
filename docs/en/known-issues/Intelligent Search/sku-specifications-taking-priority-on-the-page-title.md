## Summary


It's expected that the page title will be based on the last or initial filters. Filters from SKU specifications are always set as the last one from the breadcrumb, which takes place as the page title.


##

## Simulation


Navigating in a page like "/summer-2024?map=productclusternames" and applying any filter that is not an SKU specification will keep the page title as "Summer 2024", but a filter like "size=M" will take priority and the title will be shown as "M".

## Workaround
