## Summary


Intelligent Search has a problem with pagination of values. This results in some values not being displayed when selecting it in a condition filter, like Merchandising Rules conditions for example. If the selected field contains more than 9,999 values, only the first 9,999 will be displayed in the preview dropdown.



## Simulation


Go to a new Merchandising Rule creation page:
https://{accountName}.myvtex.com/admin/search/custom-result/create/

In the case below, the field "marca" (brand) has more than 9,999 entries, so when the "JEIBAO" value is typed, it does not appear in the dropdown to be selected.

The graphQL query that loads this list in Admin is only capable of fetching a maximum of 9,999 records.
