## Summary


Some facet values may raise an error and causes the page to not load properly.

For example, in case of a specification with the value `constructor`, the specification should generate a facet item on the PLP, but it causes the page to load with errors.


#### Simulation




- Open a search page where the specification appears as facet.
- The PLP will load with errors.


#### Workaround


Follow the instructions on the Adding SKU specifications or fields page to change the specification value to another one.
