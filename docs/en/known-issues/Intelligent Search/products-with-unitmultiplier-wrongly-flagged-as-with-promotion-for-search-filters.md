## Summary


A product whose selling price is lower than its list price will be flagged as being part of a promotion for search filtering purposes. Products with some unit multiplier may result in a wrong calculation that can affect this comparison, resulting in them wrongly receiving this flag.


##

## Simulation


The simulation depends on the occurrence of specific rounding issues, but an example of that is a product with a list price and regular price of $264.20 and a unit multiplier of 3.07.

Although the list price and regular price are the same, this item will be returned in the search filter "promotion=yes".
