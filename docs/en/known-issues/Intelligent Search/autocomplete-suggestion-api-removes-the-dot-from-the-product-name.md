## Summary


This issue occurs when searching for a term, and the autocomplete suggestion returns the product name without the dot character ".", even if it exists in the product name, resulting in incorrect search results.


##

## Simulation



1. GET` https://..com.br/api/io/_v/api/intelligent-search/autocomplete_suggestions?query=`.
2. Observe the autocomplete suggestions provided by the system.
3. Note that the dot character is missing from the selected product name.

For example, if the term "headphone" is searched in the autocomplete suggestion API, the suggestion results, if containing a dot in the name, will be displayed as "Headphone Bluetooth 5 0" instead of having the dot in the number "5.0". The correct format should be "Headphone Bluetooth 5.0".

When using this suggestion in the product_search API, will not return results.
