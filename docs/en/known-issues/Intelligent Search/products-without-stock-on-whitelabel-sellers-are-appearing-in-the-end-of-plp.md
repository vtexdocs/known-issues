## Summary


Products that do not have stock on WL sellers are appearing in the end of the PLP.



## Simulation


If you have products without stock from WL sellers, check the end of a PLP that matches the category tree from these products and you will see that they are appearing there.



## Workaround


Set `showIfNotAvailable` to true for the related products.
Thereâ€™s no workaround yet to remove the products from the end of PLP instead of showing/not showing them.
