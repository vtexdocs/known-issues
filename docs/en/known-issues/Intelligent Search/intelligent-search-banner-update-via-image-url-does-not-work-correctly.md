## Summary


In Admin V4, in the Banners module, the user has the possibility to create or update already created banners. When selecting a banner for updating, he can choose between using an HTML field or inserting a direct image link with an external URL. When selecting to insert the banner via a direct image link, the GraphQL query is triggered, which is currently not working correctly, returning `syntaxError`, consequently, error 500.


##

## Simulation


In a store with Admin V4, access the Banners module, within Search;
Select a previously created banner;
In Type, select Image;
Fill in the link fields;
When clicking Save, the screen will show a GraphQL error;
