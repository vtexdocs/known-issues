## Summary


The fetchMore function is bringing between the first and the second page some duplicated values and this causes the page display repeatedly some of the products.


##

## Simulation



In some accounts the Button that Fetches more products is bringing repeated values, this happens because the component passes 12 items (0 to 11) and the query made on GraphQL considers 18 products so 6 products may be shown repeatedly.

The show more is using different infos to bring the number of products to the screen.
