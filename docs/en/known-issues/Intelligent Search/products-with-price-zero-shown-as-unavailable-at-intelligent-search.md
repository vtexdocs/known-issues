## Summary


Products with price zero are shown as unavailable by the Intelligent Search. Different from a product with no registered price, the price set as zero defines a free product.


##

## Simulation


It's possible to simulate the scenario just by changing its price to "$ 0,00". It'll affect the frontend for search results and the APIs.
