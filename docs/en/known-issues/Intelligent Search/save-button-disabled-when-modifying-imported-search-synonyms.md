## Summary


When trying to make any change in a synonym config that was previously imported by a csv file, the save button is always disabled, no matter what change:

This is happening because when importing a file, locale information is not being automatically populated, as per the example below:

## Simulation


Import a csv file containing a synonym, try to modify any information of the uploaded synonym in admin and see that you are not allowed to save.



## Workaround


Delete the imported synonym and create the same one manually.
