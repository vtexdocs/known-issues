## Summary


The presentation of SKU variations in the PLP is limited to the variations available regardless of the skusFilter prop setting. According to our analysis, search-graphql is not delivering all variations as per the API return, so the ProductContextProvider does not receive all variations.



## Simulation


- Access the PLP and find a product that has some variations that are not available;
- Check if the components that perform the SKU filtering are correctly configured with the skusFilter prop, with the value â€œALL";
- Access the PDP of the product in question and view all variations returning in the ProductContextProvider



## Workaround


N/A
