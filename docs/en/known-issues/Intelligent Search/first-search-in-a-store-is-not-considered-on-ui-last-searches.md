## Summary


When searching in a store for the first time, your first search won't appear on "last searches", but all the others will be considered.



## Simulation


Go to a store for the first time (or clear cache), try searching anything on the searchBar. Right after going to the search page, search another thing - you'll see that the second term you searched will appear, but the first one won't.

Tested on several different accounts.



## Workaround


N/A.
