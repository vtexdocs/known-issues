## Summary


Multiple specifications with the same name are grouped into the same _"facet"_ by the Intelligent Search, which can be problematic if they have different settings.

Some attributes that may be affected are the filter, hidden and indexed/searchable toggles, field type, and value position. There's no difference between being a product or SKU specification.

It is not possible to know which property will take precedence over the other.


##

## Simulation


For a store with:
- a specification named "type" (ID 1) set as a filter (to appear in the storefront);
- another specification named "type" (but ID 2), which is not set as a filter (to stay hidden from the storefront).

The storefront may or may not render the search filter for the facet/specification "type" due to the conflict with the "isFilter" property.


##

## Workaround


Although the Catalog module does not block repeated specification names, this usage should be considered wrong.
