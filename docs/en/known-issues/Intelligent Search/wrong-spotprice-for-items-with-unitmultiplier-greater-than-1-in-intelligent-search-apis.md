## Summary


In the Intelligent Search APIs (GraphQL or REST), the `spotPrice` property from the object `items.sellers.commertialOffer` is wrong for items where the `unitMultiplier` is greater than `1`.

The `spotPrice` should represent the cheapest payment method in its single installment option in order to show the "cash price", with a discount (if any), but in this case, it ends up returning the regular price for the item.

It does not happen for items where the multiplier is lower than `1` (fracioned items).


##

## Simulation


At the Intelligent Search's REST API or GraphQL, check the property for items in this specific scenario.


##

## Workaround


The right value for `spotPrice` can be retrieved from the `Installments` array inside the same `commertialOffer` object.
