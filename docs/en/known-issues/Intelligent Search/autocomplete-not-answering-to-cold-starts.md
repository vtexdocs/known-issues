## Summary


Intelligent Search feature known as **autocomplete** is not working for some new stores even after running an internal process called _cold start_.



##

## Simulation


N/A.


##

## Workaround


Currently there's no workaround for this Known Issue, but autocomplete itself is working properly and will keep learning based on user experience, which means that a while after go-live it will work just fine for new accounts.
