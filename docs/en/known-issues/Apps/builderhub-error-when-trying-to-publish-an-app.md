## Summary


When trying to publish an app, you may encounter a builder-hub error. This intermitency normally happens in apps with self-dependency. You'll see an error such as:


    error: node@4.x builder failed to install dependencies through yarn (retries=3)yarn errors:An unexpected error occurred: "http://.vtexassets.com/_v/public/typings/v1//public/@types/: Request failed \"500 Internal Server Error\"". vtex.builder-hub@0.309.0



#### Simulation


It is not a simple problem to reproduce; it is intermittent.


#### Workaround


This may be solved after some retries, but if it persists, open a ticket to Product Support to solve it
