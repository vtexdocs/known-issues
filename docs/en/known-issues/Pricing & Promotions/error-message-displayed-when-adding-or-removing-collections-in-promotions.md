## Summary


When adding or removing collections in promotions, an error message is displayed in the UI: "Erro - Can’t create search criteria!" Despite the error message, the changes are saved successfully, and a "Promoção salva com sucesso!" message appears beneath the error. The problem is observed specifically when using the "_Different from:"_ selector with more than one collection listed. Notably, the error does not occur when saving a promotion with the _"Different from:"_ selector and only one collection listed.


##

## Simulation



1. Access the promotions management area in the admin interface.
2. Create or edit a promotion.
3. Use the "_Different from:"_ selector to add more than one collection.
4. Attempt to save the promotion.
**Expected Behavior**: The promotion should save without error messages.
**Observed Behavior**: An error message "Erro - Can’t create search criteria!" appears, but the promotion is saved successfully.
5. Test the scenario with only one collection listed under the "_Different from:"_ selector.
**Observed Behavior**: The error does not occur, and the promotion saves without issues.


##

## Workaround


The promotion is actually saved correctly despite the error message. Users can ignore the error message and validate that the changes were applied by reopening the promotion settings.
