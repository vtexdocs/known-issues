## Summary


In the new Regular Promotion form, the **category field no longer displays the full category path (hierarchy)** — it only shows the final category name.
In the old form, the inheritance path of categories (e.g. _Men > Shoes > Boots_) was automatically retrieved and displayed.


#### Simulation



1. Go to the **Admin → Promotions → Regular Promotion** module.
2. Create a Regular Promotion.
3. In the **Category** condition field, select a category.
4. Observe that only the category name is shown, without the parent categories.



#### Workaround
