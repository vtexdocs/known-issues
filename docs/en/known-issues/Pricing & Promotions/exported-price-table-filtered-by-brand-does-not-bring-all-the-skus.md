## Summary


When exporting the price table filtered by Brand in order to get a more specific result, the spreadsheet is coming incomplete to the client.

Only the skus with price showed on the first page (when the page is set with the maximum of 20 results) are exported.

##

## Simulation



1. Go to Price List of the account;
2. Filter the results by a specific Brand (and refresh the page)
3. Export `Table of base prices` or `Table of fixed prices`
4. Check that there are skus missing


##

## Workaround


Another way to get a sku price info is using API: https://developers.vtex.com/vtex-rest-api/reference/getprice
