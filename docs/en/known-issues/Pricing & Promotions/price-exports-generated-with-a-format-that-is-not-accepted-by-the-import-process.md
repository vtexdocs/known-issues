## Summary


Sometimes (there’s a 50% chance) prices are exported using a new format that is not accepted by the price import.




## Simulation


-Export a fixed price spreadsheet



## Workaround


**While we work on a solution for this issue, a workaround is:**
1. add a new row at the top of the price sheet with the text “FixedPrices” in the first cell
2. change the date format of the From and To columns to the following format 2022-05-24T07:20:50.52Z

If you need more information about the format this is the RFC3339 format
