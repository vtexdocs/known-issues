## Summary

The KIT price composition should be based upon the calculation of it's components and their quantities.

That is, a KIT's price should be:
`SKU_KIT_Price= (component_1*qty_1) + (component_2*qty_2) + (...) + (component_n*qty_n)`

However, there is currently a way to bypass this logic if the user insert a PUT Price directly on the kit sku on the Pricing Module.

## Simulation

1. Create a KIT with at least 2 components and set their price and quantities;
2. Check that the KIT price is set according to their logic mentioned above.
3. Update the KIT price on the pricing module by inserting a PUT Price on the kit sku;
4. Check that even when updating the price components and their quantities, the KIT price will remain as the put price set before.

*important note: this also happens for changes directly in the pricing module admin after creating the kit. Essentially, the kit price is only corrected created according to the formula above upon its creation, but not for posterior updates.

## Workaround

Make any changes in the components, a new PUT Price with the new calculation and the correct logic will overwrite it again, then normalizing the "wrong" behavior.
