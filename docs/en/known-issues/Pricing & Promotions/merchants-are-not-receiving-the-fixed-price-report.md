## Summary



We're currently facing a situation where the fixed price report process is not completed and therefore not being delivered in the merchant's mail.



## Simulation


In the Pricing Module, export the fixed price without any filters



## Workaround



We recommend the use of our API to get the prices or using the category filter in the UI.
