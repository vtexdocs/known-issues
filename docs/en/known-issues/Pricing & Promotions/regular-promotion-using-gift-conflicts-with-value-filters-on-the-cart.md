## Summary



The minimum value condition of an order does not work along with gifts.

When using both resources simultaneously, the gift will not be selectable by the user on the checkout UI (it won't be shown at all)



## Simulation



1. Create a promotion with a minimum value condition + a gift.
2. Go to the store's checkout with an item that is valid for this promotion.
3. A gift will not be listed on the UI, despite the order showing the promotion is being applied.



## Workaround





No workaround available
