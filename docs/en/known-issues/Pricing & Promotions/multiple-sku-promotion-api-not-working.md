## Summary


Despite the success return info on the APIs and the email, the promotion is not created on the admin (create API) or actually updated (update API).

API docs:
https://developers.vtex.com/docs/api-reference/promotions-and-taxes-api#post-/api/rnb/pvt/import/calculatorConfiguration
https://developers.vtex.com/docs/api-reference/promotions-and-taxes-api#put-/api/rnb/pvt/import/calculatorConfiguration/-promotionId-


##

## Simulation



1. Followed the steps on the docs mentioned above to create/update multiple sku promotion;
2. Received a confirmation email about the promotion being created or a success status code on the API, like 202.
3. Check on admin that the promotion was never created/updated.


##

## Workaround


No workaround.
