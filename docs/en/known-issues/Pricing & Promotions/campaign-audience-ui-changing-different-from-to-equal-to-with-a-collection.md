## Summary

When creating a target audience and setting Collections **Different from** this option is saved in the UI, after returning to the target audience it will display as Equal to in the UI, but it keeps your first choice on the API.

## Simulation

** **
Crete a Campaign audience with a target audience, in Collections, select Different From and save.
Return to the target audience and check that the option Different From changed to Equal to
