## Summary



Even if we set the field Collections as "Different from" and save the form, once we open it again the value is set as "Equal to". However, this behavior is only on the UI, on the backend the value is set correctly, having no impact on sales.

## Simulation



1. Create a Campaign Audience;
2. Create a Target Audience;
3. Set the field Collections to "Different from" and a collection;
4. Save the form and the campaign;
5. Enter again the campaign and check that the form is back to "Equal to".



## Workaround


There is no need to workaround, is just an UI error. On the backend the value is correct.
