## Summary



The Nominal Discount from promotions is not being distributed among all items in the cart.

This scenario is happening only in a few accounts.

The store has a nominal promotion and the discount is only being applied to one item in the cart, not proportionally distributing the discount to all the items like it is supposed to.


##

## Simulation




1. Create a regular promotion with a nominal discount;
2. Create a cart link where the promotion is applicable;
3. Check that the discount is being entirely applied to just one item instead of being distributed among all items.

PS: This doesn't happen every time and with every account.


##

## Workaround


To mitigate this issue, you can use the API Create or Update Coupon API to increase the `maxItemsPerClient` field. This allows the coupon to be applied to as many SKUs as permitted in this field.
