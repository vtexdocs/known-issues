## Summary


The final discount on the shopping cart is not correct when a More for Less promotion is being applied alongside a regular promotion. The discount is higher than expected.


##

## Simulation



1. Create a 3x2 promotion;
2. Create a regular promotion, lets say 15% discount that applies to the same product of the previous promotion;
3. Check the flag for the second promotion to allow accumulate;
4. Verify that the discount on the cart is higher than expected.


##

## Workaround


No workaround for this case.
