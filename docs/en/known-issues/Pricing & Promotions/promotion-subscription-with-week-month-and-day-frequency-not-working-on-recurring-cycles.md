## Summary


When a subscription promotion is set in the subscription module, the merchant has the possibility of choosing the frequency this promo will apply on the subscription.

If the frequency chosen is "week" or "day" or "month" the promotion will not apply on the recurring cycles, despite the setup.


##

## Simulation



1. Create a subscription promotion that applies on the first and recurring cycles;
2. Select the week/day/month frequency
3. Check that the recurring orders do not have the subscription applied.
