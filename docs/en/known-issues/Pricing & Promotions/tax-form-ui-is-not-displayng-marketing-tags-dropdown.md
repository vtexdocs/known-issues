## Summary


When saving taxes in the promotions module, the dropdown value for "at least one of the following" or "all of the following" is not shown after the tax is saved. Consequently, the user cannot figure out which of them is being used.


#### Simulation


1 - In the promotions module, open the tax form.
2 - Fill in the Marketing tags form with multiple values.
3 -  Save the form
4 - check it again, the form will come out empty:
