## Summary


We've identified a problem in the compatibility post prices route when sending too many requests in a small window we are not using the most updated price

We strongly recommend that all accounts stop using our pricing v1 apis.



## Simulation


Send a batch of prices updates and follow up the splunk logs



## Workaround


1- we recommend the use of the pricing v2 apis
2- better distribute the requests, wait like 30s between them.
