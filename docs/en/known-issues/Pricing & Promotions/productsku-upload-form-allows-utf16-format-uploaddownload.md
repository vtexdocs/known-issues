## Summary


Currently, if a user attempts to upload an SKU list to the regular promotion form using a .txt file, if the uploaded file is in the UTF-16 encoding format, so will be the downloaded file afterward.






## Simulation


1) Create a regular promotion and in section #2 "To which **items** will this promotion apply?", upload a UTF-16 formatted, valid SKU list to either the SKU or Product files

2) Save the promotion

3) Open it again and attempt to download the given file, its encoding format will still be UTF-16, which can often cause confusion amongst other store operators.






## Workaround


Manually input the SKUs and/or make sure the uploaded file is UTF-8
