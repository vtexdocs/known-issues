## Summary


Currently customized cluster expressions are not working on free shipping type promotions.








## Simulation


1) Create a customized cluster expression on MasterData

2) Create a cluster promotion (https://help.vtex.com/pt/tutorial/criando-promocao-para-um-cluster-de-clientes--tutorials_342) in which the promotion type is a Free Shipping benefit.

3) The promotion should use a SC that is not the default of the store.

4) Try to log with an user that is valid for this cluster and add a valid product for it on the cart (the benefit will not be applied).






## Workaround


Use a default cluster expression on the promotions settings, like isCorportate.
