## Summary


When trying to export a fixed price spreadsheet using the category filters, some skus do not appear on the spreadsheet despite having fixed prices. The usual amount of skus being returned is 250.


##

## Simulation



1. Select a category with more than 250 skus with fixed prices and use the filter on the price UI;
2. Export the fixed prices;
3. Check that some skus were not exported so they don't appear on the spreadsheet.


##

## Workaround


Use different filters or a **combination of the category filter with something else**.
