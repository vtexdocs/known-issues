## Summary


Intermittently, when we open a promotion, the Start Date and End Date fields display the current date, and the Start Hour and End Hour fields display 12:00 AM. Despite the incorrect information in the UI, the dates set in the promotion are not affected.



## Simulation


This scenario can happen randomly, however, we find it most often in the Safari browser. To reproduce:
1. Open a promotion
2. Check the Expiration Date form



## Workaround


Reloading the page is enough to correct the information on the UI
