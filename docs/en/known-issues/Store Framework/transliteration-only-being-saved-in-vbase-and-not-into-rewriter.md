## Summary



When transliterating the urls through the catalog rewriter is not storing it, or is not receiving any notification through the broadcaster, we are only storing it in vbase


##

## Simulation



Transl

Check the rewriter with the linkId that you created at admin/graphql-ide and choose the rewriter app:


    { internal{ get(path: "yourLinkdIdHere"){ id } }}




##

## Workaround



Run the following query on the rewriter


    { internal{ get(path: "yourTranslatedCategoryNameSlugified"){ id from declarer type query bindingÂ  origin resolveAs } }}


Save the returned values, you will need to use them in the next step

Run the following mutation just changing the from parameter, the others must be the same as above:


    mutation saveInternal($route: InternalInput!) { internal { save(route: $route) { from declarer type id binding resolveAs origin } }}{ "route": { "from": "yourLinkId", "declarer": "yourSavedDeclarer", "type": "yourSavedType", "binding": "yourSavedBinding", "id": "yourSavedId", "origin": "yourSavedOrigin", "resolveAs": "TheOriginalNameOfTheCategory" --here in cyrilic }}



> For more information regarding those params, you can consult: https://developers.vtex.com/vtex-developer-docs/docs/rewriter


Now, we are going to delete the old route (the one saved with the name)


    mutation saveInternal($route: InternalInput!) { internal { delete(path: "yourTranslatedCategoryNameSlugified") { id } }}
