## Summary


Some functions of the sticky layout component won't work as expected when viewed through Safari browser


##

## Simulation


Using the sticky layout and trying to view it on Safari will sometimes not behave properly. Bellow are some of the observed behaviors:

- the menus might appear floating even thought they are set to be fixed position


##

## Workaround


Since this is a very specific use case for a very specific browser, there is currently no workaround for it.
