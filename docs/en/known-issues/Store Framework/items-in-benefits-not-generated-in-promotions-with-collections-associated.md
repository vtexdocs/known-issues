## Summary



When having a promotion with products/skus associated through a collection, the productContext isn't prepared to create the items array inside benefits associated with the products of the collection


##

## Simulation




- Create a promotion
- Associate the products for this promotion through a collection
- Open one of the products that should have a promotion
- Open your browser's console
- Check on your React Dev Tools extension for productContextProvider
- Open benefits.items, it will be empty or with the sku with the same id of the collection


##

## Workaround



The only possible way to have benefits.items filled is filling all skus associated with the promotion instead of a cluster/collection
