## Summary


When looking at the benefits array inside of the ProductContextProvider on the PDP of a product we can see that not all the products are returned and the ones returned are shuffled. Both lists of products within the promotion are together on the same array. It only happens when the promotion is a Buy Together type.


##

## Simulation


Go to the PDP of a product that has a Buy Together promotion
Try to look at the benefits array inside the ProductContextProvider
Not all the products will be returned on the items array, and there will be no differentiation between the lists of products within the promotion

## Workaround
