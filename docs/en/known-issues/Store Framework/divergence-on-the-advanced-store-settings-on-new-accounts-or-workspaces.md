## Summary


On new workspaces or accounts that never changed the advanced configurations of the Store Settings can verify an inconsistency between the information on the UI and the flag applied to the account.


##

## Simulation



- Create a new workspace
- Go to the Store Settings in the Advanced tab
- See that some flags are set on the UI
- Verify the configurations using the settings plugin with the following command `vtex settings get vtex.store`.
- See that the flags are not applied.


##

## Workaround


Click on the "Save" button on the UI
