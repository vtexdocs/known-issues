## Summary

The page's layout changes to mobile version when printing (CTRL+P) is activated twice in Google Chrome Desktop.

## Simulation

In Google Chrome desktop, go to any page of the store and press CTRL+P, then cancel it, and CTRL+P again. Even if the printing is cancelled again, the page's layout remains as mobile until it is refreshed.

This problem doesn't happen in every store using Store Framework.

## Workaround

No known workaround, although some CSS manipulation with `@media print` might solve the issue. 

Since the behavior to reproduce this issue is very specific and unusual, this isn't very impactful for any store.
