## Summary


When selecting any image on the PDP of a product, if you move from this PDP directly to another PDP, the position of the image won't be erased - if you were seing the third image, you will see directly the third image on the new PDP.



## Simulation


Go to a PDP and select any image that's not the first one (ex: image number 2). Now search for a product and select it on the suggestions of the searchBar (do not go to the PLP of this search). You will notice that the image that will be selected on this new PDP will be at the same position (image number 2), even though it's a different PDP.



## Workaround


Refresh the page and it will be on the first image.
