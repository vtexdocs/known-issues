## Summary


When swiping a product image in quick view on mobile when there's a slider layout in the background, both sliders are going to move to the next instead of just the image in quick view


##

## Simulation




- Open a quick view on mobile with a slider layout on the background
- Try swiping the product image

The expected behavior is that not only the product image from quick view will change, but also the products in slider layout/shelf


##

## Workaround


N/A
