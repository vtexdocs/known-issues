## Summary



When you try to export the redirect, either through the terminal or through the page on the CMS it brings different sizes of files, with possible different results inside, this isn't the expected behavior since there are no changes done on the redirects that could explain the differences.



##

## Simulation



(Terminal) Follow the steps on the documentation: https://developers.vtex.com/vtex-developer-docs/docs/vtex-io-documentation-managing-url-redirects

Check the files returned and you can see in some cases the difference between the two files extracted.

(Admin UI) Go the the admin > CMS > Redirects change between the pages on the pagination and click on export you will see the differences in the files that are returned.
