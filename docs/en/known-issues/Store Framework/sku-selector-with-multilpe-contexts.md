## Summary



SKU selector inside modal/quick view is not in the same context that is in the search page and product page.

##

## Simulation



- Go to any store that has a quick view and sku-selector.
- Pick an SKU and go to the quick view mode
- Change the SKU inside the quick view modal
- Exit quick view mode and you will notice that the sku didn't change, it just changed inside the quick view context
