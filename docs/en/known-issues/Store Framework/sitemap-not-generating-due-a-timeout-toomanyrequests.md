## Summary


When generating a new sitemap for a store with a large number of products (this normally happens with stores that have around 100k products), the `vtex.store-sitemap` app may receive an error of tooManyRequests.


##

## Simulation


If your store has a huge number of products (normally around 100k), try generating a new sitemap. If the sitemap is not finished, this can be related to the tooManyRequest error, which is related to this huge amount of products.

## Workaround


Open a ticket to the product support team and we will analyze it.
