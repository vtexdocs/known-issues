## Summary


When a product exists in the catalog but is out of stock and has the `Show when out of stock` flag set to `false`, accessing its URL returns a `200 OK` status code and redirects to a URL containing the `ProductLinkNotFound` parameter. The correct behavior should be to return a `404 Not Found` response immediately.


#### Simulation




1. Ensure a product exists in VTEX.
2. Set the product's inventory to zero.
3. Set the `Show when out of stock` flag to `false`.
4. Try accessing the product’s PDP URL.
5. Observe that the request returns a `200 OK` status and redirects to a page with `ProductLinkNotFound` in the URL.
