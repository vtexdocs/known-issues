## Summary


After creating wrong redirects containing characters that should not be uploaded: ie.: #, queries, or redirects that should be created on the server level, the mass upload/download of the csv through the CLI doesn't work anymore.


##

## Simulation


Create a redirect for a query for example: /?binding=XXXXX
Delete the redirect by the graphql IDE (you won't be able to delete otherwise)
Try to download or upload the CSV of the redirects through the CLI and you want be able to do it.

##

## Workaround


There is currently no workaround for this and the CLI mass download will be unusable.
