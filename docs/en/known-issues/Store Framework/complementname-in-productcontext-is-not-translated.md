## Summary


Since the Catalog Search Documents Translation API does not translate the field for short description called complementName the product context shows the original text in Internationalized stores.


##

## Simulation



- Translate a short description (complementName) in an Internationalized store. It can be either through Messages or Catalog Translation app.
- Check the productContext for that product in a different language using React Dev Tools or querying the productContext.
- You'll see that its value is not translated.

- You can check that the catalog API does not bring this value translated: `curl --location 'http://api.vtexinternal.com/api/search-documents/documents/translations/?an=&decompress=true' \`



##

## Workaround


None VTEX native app uses this field. But if your are using in a Custom app you can create a new SKU or Product specification to use as the complementName or query the translation in your custom app.
