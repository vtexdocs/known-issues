## Summary


The Seller Selector component presents inconsistency in delivery/shipping prices based on the order amount.

Example:
Regular Promotion:
When the customer places an order above the X value, the shipping value will be free.

Based on a scenario with the configuration above, when performing a shipping simulation using the Seller Selector, the component will use a GraphQL shipping query, equivalent to a request of the Simulation API, however, for each seller that the product is available, based on the postal code of the customer, the query will receive an item as a parameter, thus setting up a "cart with multiple items", therefore, depending on the value of the order, exceeding the limit value of the promotion and applying free shipping.



## Simulation


Based on the example above:
Create a promotion where the type and the amount of the discount will be "Free shipping";
Test the Seller Selector component in a PDP with a product that it's related to the promotion above and available in several different sellers.



## Workaround
