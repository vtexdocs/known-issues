## Summary



Infocard has a prop called blockClass to add custom classes into the component, but this property is not working


##

## Simulation



Open your infoCard component, add the prop blockClass
Check your elements on DOM and you won't find any infocard element with the added class


##

## Workaround


Build your own infocard with our components vtex.flex-layout, vtex.image and vtex.rich-text, this will give you more flexibility to build your infocard
