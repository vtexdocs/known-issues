## Summary


Normally, after an order is placed, the orderFormId is not updated, causing items to remain visible in the cart. This issue affects FastStore accounts.
This can also happen without closing an order, just on cleaning the cookies and trying to check the secure environment again.
This issue may be related to the delay in updating the orderFormId due to changes related to the checkout cookie.

After the gatewayCallback response, the expected scenario would be a new orderFormId cookie for the user. This scenario is broken because the domain of the new cookie does not match the domain of the user's previous cookie (because of the secure domain).


#### Simulation



- Complete an order on a Faststore account
- Return to the home page
- The items that you just bought will remain in your cart


#### Workaround


This issue still impacts stores using the v1 version of Faststore.

For stores using v3 that are with our CLI updated, the solution is to update to the domain unification feature, so this issue will be solved. You can open a support ticket asking for this feature.
