## Summary


When we perform a search that fails, the response page is not found instead of a "something went wrong, please try again." This gives the user the wrong idea that the results don't exist instead of a momentaneous error on the search result.


##

## Simulation


When a search page returns an error (not a "not-found" search, but an error itself), the response is not an error message.


##

## Workaround
