## Summary


Stores that are using Faststore v2 (repositories starting from `starter.store` and using the app `admin-faststore`) and V3 (repositories starting from `starter.store` and using the app `vtex.webops`) are not loading the GTM script when using the native third-party scripts. This is related to the Partytown.


##

## Simulation


If your store is using the Faststore V2 or V3, try to add the GTM script by following [this documentation](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/faststore/project-structure-handling-third-party-scripts). The events will not be correctly sent.


##

## Workaround


The client can load the script using a custom component instead of the native one without Partytown. It would be an override of our native component.
