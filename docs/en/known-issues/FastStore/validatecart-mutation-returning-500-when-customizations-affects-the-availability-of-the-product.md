## Summary


When a product is unavailable, our default behavior is to return the last valid cart and errors on the `cart.messages`. Products already added to the cart may become unavailable due to merchant manual customizations (e.g. manually changing pickup points/seller in the cart). This behavior can lead to a 500 error on the validateCart mutation, making the cart unavailable to customer actions, such as deleting the product from the cart.


#### Simulation


It is not an easy context to simulate; it may involve customization on the store side.
But an example would be changing from a pickup point where the product was available to one where it is not anymore.


#### Workaround


As a workaround, the team developed a feature flag to change the default cart behavior of returning errors from the server-side, allowing unavailable products in the cart and transferring the responsibility of handle error scenarios to the client-side through merchant customizations.
