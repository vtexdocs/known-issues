## Summary



When saving the advanced settings splitted by binding, the system is registering for all of them, but, when requesting these values for render runtime, we get the values from the binding and not from the global context:

https://github.com/vtex-apps/store/blob/46e3df3ecba20170fc3a6eebf12370969e3b5abf/react/components/ProductTitleAndPixel.tsx#L186


##

## Simulation



You will need a store with multi binding and enable binding for store settings at admin/cms/store:

Save your advanced settings and check your vtex store settings:

https://infra.io.vtex.com/apps/v0///apps/vtex.store/settings

You will notice that advanced settings will be outside bindings contexts



##

## Workaround



Add the settings that you want through a PUT into the settings key inside one of the binding's object:
