## Summary


When you are developing your store and adding multiple content types, the "Create Document" button will only display some of the content types. This happens because the button is supposed to list all the types of documents (content types), but if you have a lot of them, there is no scrolling through the list.

This normally will only happen in headless projects, since you can't add custom content types in Faststore.


#### Simulation


It is a hard scenario to simulate; you must add a lot of new document types to your store, and you'll see that the list will be cut, and it is not possible to scroll.


#### Workaround


N/A, but in some cases, you can still see the options when zooming out in your browser.
