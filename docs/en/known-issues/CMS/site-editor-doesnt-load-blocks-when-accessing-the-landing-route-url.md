## Summary


If you try to access a page on the site editor by using the landing page it does not load the blocks, it stays infinite loading. For example `https://.myvtex.com/admin/cms/site-editor/.`


##

## Simulation


Try to access the site editor by a direct URL with its landing page. The blocks will not load and you will not be able to perform any changes.


##

## Workaround


You can access the site editor by its normal URL(without the landing page at the end) and navigate normally through the site.
