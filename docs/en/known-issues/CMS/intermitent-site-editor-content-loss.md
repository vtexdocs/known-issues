## Summary


Every content change in Site Editor inserts changes to the content.json file, stored in a bucket on AWS S3 and on the content_render.js. Some customers have reported a loss of Site Editor content after some standard procedures, such as workspace promotion.

The content from the workspace is not taken into the master environment after the promotion process. Since the default promotion policy for handling conflicts is `masterWins` the workspace content is not taken to production on conflict cases.


##

## Simulation


The scenario is intermittent. However, it has been reported in two different scenarios:

**1. When promoting a production workspace to master:**
This issue is new and different from the previous one that originated this KI. This has been happening since Jan/2024 when we introduced the `content_render.json`.  This is the step to step where normally this issue occurs:

1.1 Creation of a production workspace;

1.2 Update the workspace content. A new reference to this content is created, pointing to a file on S3 that is separated from the master;

1.3 Update the master; this will create a conflict. The reference created above starts pointing to the master, so the problem occurs. It only goes back to normal after the conflict resolution;

1.4 Make the promotion process on the workspace. It will still point to the master content but invalidate the workspace content.



Remember that in this case, the `content.json` file and the `content_render.js `file can have different information, so the content will only be "lost" after updating something on the site editor. This means the content will not necessarily be lost right after promoting the workspace. It is also important to notice that the loss is just partial (only the content created on the workspace is affected).

**2. When installing a new version in a test workspace:**
Customers reported that when installing a new theme version in a test workspace, the content of the category pages was deleted.

This normally happens due to changes in the project structure, such as treepaths. It is important to remember that if a change in the treepath is required, the content should be added again.
