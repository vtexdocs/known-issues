## Summary


The feature that mocks the data between workspaces inside the Headless CMS is currently not working. Right now, the drafts that you create in a workspace can also be seen on the master.


#### Simulation


Try to create a new draft on a workspace, just as in the example below, you'll see that the mock version will be saved:

After editing, try saving your changes, the mock version will become a normal draft:

But if you access the master environment of your store, the draft will also be there:

This draft can also be published
