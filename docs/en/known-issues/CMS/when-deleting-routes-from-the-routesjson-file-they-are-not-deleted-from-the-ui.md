## Summary


If you create a route in your theme's `routes.json` file, the route will not be deleted from the admin.


#### Simulation


Create a page on your themes under the routes.json file:

The page will be correctly created on the admin:

If you delete that route from the theme, the admin reference will still be there. But you will still be able to edit the routes on the admin.


#### Workaround


You can open a ticket to the support team asking to delete those routes.
