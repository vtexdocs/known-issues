## Workaround


Upload images without use drag and drop, or,

Try to roll back to an older version of admin-pages without some fixes and CMS Media Management, that is the version of admin-pages 4.43.1

Run `vtex install vtex.admin-pages@4.43.1`
This will solve the issue about drag and drop, but other issues can show up again
