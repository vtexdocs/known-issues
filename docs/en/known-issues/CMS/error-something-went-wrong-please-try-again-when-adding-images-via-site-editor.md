## Summary


When adding images via Site Editor, the message "`Something went wrong. Please try again.`" can occasionally occur.
This is due to the number of images per block. At the moment, we don't have an exact number of images that causes this issue, but we have noticed this behavior above 20 images in the same block.


##

## Simulation



- Access the CMS Site Editor (for example https://my-account-here.myvtex.com/admin/cms/site-editor);
- Select the block with the new images to be added;
- When the addition is saved, the message "`Something went wrong. Please try again.`" will appear in the bottom right-hand corner:

##

## Workaround


You can add the images directly to the theme, or break them into blocks with flex layout (ref https://developers.vtex.com/docs/apps/vtex.flex-layout).
