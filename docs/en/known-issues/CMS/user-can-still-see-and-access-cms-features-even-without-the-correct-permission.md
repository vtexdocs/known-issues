## Summary


If the user doesn't have any of the CMS permissions the user shouldn't be able to access or even see the CMS modules. But it is not happening.


##

## Simulation


Try accessing the CMS modules using a user that doesn't have the following LM permissions:

      CMS:

- See CMS menu on the top-bar
- Settings

GraphQL:
- CMS GraphQL API

The user will still be able to access and see the resources (but not edit).
