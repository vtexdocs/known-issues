## Summary


During tests with Personal Shopper, it was observed that only one of the agents assigned to an active session received the email notification, while the other did not. This behavior occurs when **manual agent assignment** is enabled and has been reported in **multiple accounts**, not just one.


#### Simulation



1. Enable manual agent assignment in the account.
2. Assign two agents to an active Personal Shopper session.
3. Start a call with a customer from the Admin channel.
4. Observe the following behavior:
  - Only one of the agents receives the email notification.
  - The other agent receives no notification.


#### Workaround



1. Access the account Admin.
2. Identify the Shopper user who is not receiving email notifications.
3. Delete the user from the corresponding configuration.
4. Recreate the user using the same email address and original configuration.
5. Save the changes.
6. Run a new test to confirm that email notifications are sent correctly.
