## Summary

When the product is modified by Web Service, the name of the user who effected the update is not recorded.

The platform maintains the name of the last user instead of overwiring the information on the Web Service.

## Simulation

Updating a product via Web Service.

## Workaround

There is no practical workaround. The alternative would be to access the products after the update by Webservice and save them again, thus leaving the last user registered.
