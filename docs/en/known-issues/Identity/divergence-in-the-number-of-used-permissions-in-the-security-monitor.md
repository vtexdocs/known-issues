## Summary


The Security Monitor shows a divergence number of used permissions in the _finding of Excessive Permissions_ for App Keys shared between accounts and subaccount(s) (multiaccount architecture).


#### Simulation


Conditions to reproduce the issue:

- Account with multiaccount architecture;
- Exists App Key shared between account and its subaccount(s);
- Account that uses the VTEX Shield and has the Security Monitor;
- This shared App Key is being reported as a finding of type Excessive Permission in the Security Monitor.

Steps:
In the accounts with the shared App Key

- Open the Security Monitor;
- In any of the tabs (Open, Snoozed and Closed) insert the App Key in the search bar;
- Click on the result with type _Excessive Permissions_;
- You'll see on the opened modal that the number of _used permissions_ is divergent between the accounts.

As we are dealing with a shared App Key, it should exhibit the number of the _used permissions_ in all the accounts/subaccounts, not only the number regarding the account where we're looking at.


#### Workaround


There is no workaround available.
