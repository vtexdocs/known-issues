## Summary


If an admin user only has the role "**User Administrator - RESTRICTED**" ("**Save user**" resource), the list of users is not available and it is not possible to make any necessary edits or deletions.


##

## Simulation



- Have an user with only the role "**User Administrator - RESTRICTED**";
- Access the "**Admin Users**" page with this user (e.g. https://my-account-here.myvtex.com/admin/users);
- You may notice that the list is empty, even with users already registered ("_No users found :: The user search returned an empty list. Try removing any search filters or adding new users to this account._"):

- It is possible to add the user you want, and include the necessary roles, but we can't access the users to add/edit/remove roles, or even delete the user through their registration, but only through the role.


##

## Workaround


You can add or remove the user to the role by accessing the role directly.

You can also create a custom role with only the resources "**Get paged roles**" and "**Get paged users**":

And then, add it to the user who can save users.
