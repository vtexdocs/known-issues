## Summary


When logging into the store from the Google app (only the Google app and not in the Google Chrome browser on iOS devices), the option loops and never opens Google to choose the account.


#### Simulation


-Use the Google App on IOS;
-Access the site that has Google authentication enabled in the webstore;
-Click on sign in and choose "Sign in with Google";


#### Workaround


Use another more conventional browser to access the store, for example Google Chrome.
