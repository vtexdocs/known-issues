## Sumario


We were not able to reproduce this issue, although it is reproduced consistently by the CX team. When we import a new spreadsheet with the fixed price information, we receive from a confirmation spreadsheet on our email with the result of the import. This spreadsheet have the status column sometimes at one column, sometimes at another column.


## Simulaci√≥n


- https://www.loom.com/share/8487e8940b424b6db0fe58a0981f82a4;
- Go to any store and try to upload a fixed price spreadsheet;
- Check the confirmation email with the spreadsheet with the issue.



## Workaround


Edit the spreadsheet to use only one column for the status information.
